<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">In</span> issuing the concluding Volume of this work, we take the opportunity
to notice some points in the previous portions which have given rise to
discussion.</p>

<p>In Vol. <small>I.</small> p. 297 we express disagreement with Mr. W. Galloway’s opinion
regarding the age of the chancel walls of St. Blane’s, Bute. Mr.
Galloway having asked for an opportunity of defending his views, we have
pleasure in publishing his observations in the Appendix to this Volume.</p>

<p>Reference is made in Vol. <small>II.</small> p. 172 to Mr. T. L. Watson’s theory
regarding the vaulting of the lower church in St. Mungo’s Cathedral,
Glasgow. Having recently had the privilege, on the invitation of Mr. P.
Macgregor Chalmers, of attending a meeting on the spot, when the usually
obscure edifice was well lit up, and when it was shown by Mr. Chalmers
that the points on which Mr. Watson based his opinion were untenable, we
see no reason to believe that the beautiful design of the vaulting and
the plan of the shrine were ever intended to be carried out in a mode
different from that in which they are executed.</p>

<p>When treating of Melrose Abbey (Vol. <small>II.</small> p. 378) we ventured to
criticise the views expressed by Mr. Chalmers in his work, <i>A Scots
Mediæval Architect</i>. As Mr. Chalmers has been kind enough to approach us
directly, taking exception to our remarks, we are glad to afford him, in
an Appendix to this Volume, the opportunity he desires of stating his
defence of his views.</p>

<p>Mr. Chalmers has done good service in drawing attention to some examples
of Scottish mediæval architecture of a late date, which show a
remarkable revival in point of design when compared with the general
architecture of the country at the time.</p>

<p>From the series of examples given in this Volume there can scarcely be
any question as to the gradual deterioration of ecclesiastical
architecture which occurred generally throughout Scotland during the
latter half of the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth
centuries, and it is certainly surprising to find some exceptionally
good work in a few structures of that period. Amongst these is the aisle
of Car Fergus, in Glasgow Cathedral, the vaulting of which building is
of about the date of 1500, as is evident from its containing several
specimens of Archbishop Blacader’s arms. The work is not all equal, but
the vaulting has the groining (a rare kind of construction in Scotland
at the period) well executed, and the bosses show a wonderful amount and
variety of design. Some of the latter (such as that in the illustration
kindly supplied by Mr. Chalmers in the Appendix) are admirable.</p>

<p>Mr. Chalmers has brought forward a considerable amount of evidence
regarding the rood screen in St. Mungo’s, which point to its being an
exceptionally fine specimen of late pointed work. The vaulting and some
other portions of the presbytery of Melrose Abbey are also classed by
Mr. Chalmers in the same category.</p>

<p>The subject is an interesting one, and all students of Scottish
architecture must feel indebted to Mr. Chalmers for drawing special
attention to it. We trust the point will be further investigated.</p>

<p>There is one consideration connected with this revival to which we would
draw attention, viz., that mentioned in the text (Vol. <small>III.</small> pp. 6 and 7)
that a certain excellence in the carving and the design of the smaller
features of the architecture observable in the later work may have been
due to the foreign artists introduced at the time. We might, in view of
the above circumstances, have given this remark a wider scope, so as to
apply to such works as those above referred to and similar examples.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence in the Exchequer Rolls that French
master-masons were employed by James <small>IV.</small> and <small>V.</small> Thus the Merliouns,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a
distinguished family of French master-masons, were in the royal service
at Stirling in 1496, and members of the family are found at Linlithgow,
Dunbar, Ravenscraig, Perth Church, &amp;c. Latterly the king’s <i>French
master-mason</i> became a regular court appointment, and the office was
held by several Frenchmen.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This importation of foreign artists may perhaps account for some of the
exceptionally good examples, especially in connection with places
favoured by royalty; but a good deal of time would necessarily elapse
before such work could become general. Hence the revival was limited,
while the architecture generally gradually deteriorated or changed to
Renaissance.</p>

<p>The monument of Bishop Kennedy, in St. Salvator’s, St. Andrews (a design
undoubtedly superior to the general Scottish work of the period), is
probably a French example, both in design and execution.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Chalmers lays stress on the influence of Queen Margaret’s marriage
to James <small>IV.</small> as probably having produced some of the imitations of
English perpendicular work found at Melrose and Linlithgow, and this may
possibly have been the case.</p>

<p>In a review of Vol. <small>II.</small> in the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> attention
was drawn to
an error in the description of St. Andrews Cathedral (p. 31), where the
restored illustration (Fig. 453) shows a single central shaft in the
windows of the chapter house, instead of two coupled shafts. The shafts
are gone, but the two bases are still traceable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have to thank the numerous clergymen, proprietors, custodians, and
others, to whom it has been necessary to apply for permission to visit
the various churches, for their assistance, which was always freely
given. Our acknowledgments are also due to those gentlemen who have
kindly continued their contributions to our work in the form of drawings
and descriptions of churches, especially to Mr. T. S. Robertson, Dundee,
and Mr. William Galloway, Whithorn. Mr. R. Weir Schultz, London; Mr.
John W. Small, Stirling; Mr. F. R. Coles, Edinburgh, and others have
also been good enough to furnish us with several drawings and
descriptions for this Volume, as is noted in the text.</p>

<p>To the Librarians of the Advocates’ Library and the University Library
of Edinburgh, and the Keeper of the National Museum of the Antiquaries
of Scotland, we are greatly indebted for their valuable assistance.</p>

<p>We desire, further, to express our obligation to Mr. Alexander Ross,
architect, Inverness, and Mr. R. Bruce Armstrong, for permission to use
illustrations from their published works; and to Mr. W. Rae Macdonald,
Edinburgh, and Mr. R. C. Walker, Dundee, for their aid in connection
with the heraldry of the buildings and monuments.</p>

<small>FROM THE EARLIEST CHRISTIAN TIMES TO THE<br /> SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</small><br /><br />
<small>V O L U M E &nbsp; I I I.</small></h1>

<h2><a name="THIRD_OR_LATE_POINTED_PERIOD" id="THIRD_OR_LATE_POINTED_PERIOD"></a>THIRD OR LATE POINTED PERIOD.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">In</span> passing from the Middle Pointed to the Late Pointed periods in
Scotland, we do not find any distinct break in the style of architecture
such as exists between the First and Second Pointed periods. The middle
pointed style passes by gentle gradation into the late pointed style,
and there is some difficulty in fixing the period when the one ceases
and the other begins. When buildings such as Melrose Abbey and Lincluden
College are compared with Dunglass, Corstorphine, and other collegiate
churches of the late period, the difference of style is very apparent,
and it is at once seen that these edifices belong to different
categories. But between such examples as Haddington Church and Paisley
Abbey the distinction of style is not at first sight so striking. It is
only when the whole character of the architecture is considered that it
can be determined to which category each structure belongs. Although the
line of division is thus to a certain extent arbitrary, there are some
characteristics of the third pointed period which are peculiar to it,
and render it a distinct and well marked epoch. This period, although
inferior in many respects to those which preceded it, yet comprises more
than any other certain elements which give it a claim to be considered
peculiarly Scottish and national.</p>

<p>Many of the structures described in Vol <small>II.</small> as belonging (in part at
least) to the decorated period bear some resemblance to those of the
same style in England. These edifices are mostly of considerable size,
and contain all the usual divisions of choir, nave, and transept, nearly
always with aisles. They are also generally vaulted with groined vaults,
having wooden roofs above the vaults. The details of the buildings are
likewise of similar character in both localities.</p>

<p>As in the preceding period, the large churches of the third pointed
period in Scotland are nearly all restorations. No new churches of great
size were undertaken. Some of the older large churches which had been
damaged were reconstructed, but the new churches erected were almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span>
entirely confined to parish or collegiate structures. The largest new
church is that of Trinity College in Edinburgh, founded by the widowed
queen of James <small>II.</small> Only a few of the larger of these churches have
aisles, and are roofed with groined vaulting.</p>

<p>Most of the new edifices of the late pointed style in Scotland differ
from those in England in many particulars. The Scottish churches are, as
already stated, usually smaller in size, and consist of single
compartments without aisles. Although frequently designed as cross
churches, with choir, nave, and transepts, they are rarely finished, the
choir or the choir and transepts being often the only portions carried
out. The east end frequently terminates with a three-sided apse. This
feature is almost entirely characteristic of the late pointed period. It
undoubtedly owes its origin to the Scottish alliance and intercourse
with France. But the leading and distinguishing feature of our late
pointed style is the vaulting, the pointed barrel vault being almost
universally employed. We have seen that a pointed barrel vault was used
at Lincluden and Bothwell collegiate churches. It was, however, in the
later edifices, after the middle of the fifteenth century, that that
form of vault came into general use. This kind of arch was of simple
construction, and was much employed in the castles of the period, being
found convenient&mdash;first, because it was of easy construction; and
second, because it could conveniently carry a roof composed of
overlapping stones. This style of roof had the double advantage of being
fireproof, and in the case of the castles, where it was often kept flat,
of forming a platform from which the defenders could operate.</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that many features of domestic
architecture were at this time imported into ecclesiastical
architecture, and the above feature of the pointed barrel vault carrying
a stone roof is the first and most important.</p>

<p>In carrying out this kind of vaulting in churches, several difficulties
were encountered and had to be overcome. The most serious of these
difficulties was the junction of the transepts, or side chapels, with
the choir and nave. In the earlier Gothic churches this was managed by
running the vault of the transepts or chapels into that of the nave, and
forming a groin at the intersection. But the peculiarity of the late
Scottish churches is that they carefully avoid all groins and
intersections of arches. The junction of the vaults at the above
intersections is, therefore, managed by a special contrivance, viz., by
keeping the barrel vaults of the transepts or chapels quite apart from
those of the central nave, the side vaults being stopped on gables
carried up on arches in the line of the main side walls to receive them.
The main nave vault is thus carried throughout the whole length of the
central nave without a break, and where the opening into the transepts
or chapels occurs, the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span> vault rests on an arch thrown across the
side openings in the line of the main walls, and at a level below the
springing of the main vault. The outer stone roofs of the transepts are
also kept independent of that of the central nave, and do not mitre into
it.</p>

<p>The windows of these churches, which have nearly always pointed
arch-heads, are necessarily placed at a low level, so as to allow the
point of the arch-head to come beneath the spring of the main vault.
This is done so as to avoid even a small groin, such as would be
required if the window arch-head were carried up into the main vault.
The object is two-fold&mdash;first, to escape the difficulty of the
intersection of the vaults; and second, to avoid the small gablets over
the windows and the small stone roofs and valleys which would be
required at the junction of these with the main external stone roofs.
The above features are all well exemplified at Ladykirk, Seton College,
Corstorphine, and many other churches.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that the vaulting in England in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries had also to some extent reverted to the plan of
relying chiefly for strength on plain surface vaulting, and not on the
ribs as in the earlier period. The example from Winchester Cathedral<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
helps to explain this. The intersection of the vaults is there very
slight, and the numerous ribs introduced are almost all used
ornamentally. This is also the case in the fan vaulting, so common in
England in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in which the ribs or
tracery are applied as ornaments on the surface of the vaults.</p>

<p>Ornamental ribs are not uncommon in Scottish roofs. An early example,
somewhat similar to that at Winchester, still exists over the presbytery
of Melrose Abbey, where the intersection of the vaults is almost
entirely abandoned, and numerous ornamental surface ribs are introduced.
In later examples, however, the intersection of the vaults is completely
given up, and any ribs employed are useless except as ornaments. Such
are the roofs of St. Mirren’s Chapel, Paisley, and the choir of Seton
College.</p>

<p>An example of the shifts the builders were put to in order to escape
intersecting vaults may be seen in the apse of Stirling Church. In other
examples, such as Dunglass and Queensferry, the nave, choir, and
transepts have walls carried up on the four sides of the crossing,
against which the pointed barrel vaults are stopped, and access is
furnished to the various arms of the church by small archways like
doorways in the walls. At Whitekirk the crossing is exceptional, having
a groined vault; but the choir, &amp;c., have pointed barrel vaults, which
stop upon walls at the crossing.</p>

<p>In the case of the apse of Linlithgow Church the difficulty of the
intersection of the apse with the choir vault was avoided by sticking on
the apse against the east end wall, like a large bow window. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span>
enabled the apse windows to be carried to a good height. Generally
speaking the windows in the apse are very low, being kept down below the
main arch, and admit little light, thus rendering the vault extremely
dark, as, for instance, at Seton Church.</p>

<p>In most of the collegiate churches the barrel vaults supported a roof
composed of carefully wrought flag-stones. These stones are arranged in
courses, running from the eaves to the ridge, and every alternate course
is higher than, and rests on, the edges of the intermediate courses.
Each stone also overlaps the course which is below it in the slope of
the roof. There is thus a considerable amount of cutting and fitting
required, which is usually carefully executed. Sometimes each stone is
hollowed in the centre, so as to carry the water away from the joints.
The gutters are also wrought in stone on the same principle. Roofs of
this description might evidently be made almost level, and in the case
of many of the castles (as on the keep of Craigmillar Castle) that is
done, and a platform for defence is thus created. In the churches,
however, the stone roofs are usually pretty steep.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that this form of roof was a reproduction in Scotland,
in the fifteenth century, of a fireproof form of construction which was
much used in Provence in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. But in this
country it was to all appearance an independent invention, as Provence
in the fifteenth century was, architecturally speaking, very remote, and
was cut off from Scotland by the intermediate styles of England and
France.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the pointed barrel vault, although very general,
was not universally employed in Scotland during the third period. One or
two notable examples of well constructed groined vaults are to be found,
such as the vaulting of Trinity College Church and that of “Blackader’s
Aisle” in Glasgow Cathedral. But these are exceptions to the general
rule.</p>

<p>In Rosslyn College we have the finest example of the late Scottish forms
of vaulting carried out to their fullest extent, together with some
exceptional designs. This church differs from most of the other
collegiate churches in having side aisles, and also in having groined
vaults in the east end. The plan of the latter portion of the building,
being copied from the arrangement at the east end of Glasgow Cathedral,
has been carried out with groining, in imitation of the original; but in
the other parts of the structure the vaulting conforms to that of the
third pointed period in Scotland. The main central roof is covered with
a continuous pointed barrel vault without a break, except an ornamental
rib over each division of the bays. The soffits of each panel of the
arch thus formed are carved with stars, fleur-de-lys, and other
enrichments. The side aisles are also covered with a series of pointed
barrel vaults. Each of these aisle vaults forms an extension of the main
pier arch of the choir, carried across the aisle at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span> right angles to the
main choir. The Scottish plan of avoiding groins is thus adhered to. The
above arrangement of the aisle vaults also enables the aisle windows to
be carried up to a good height. The barrel vaults across the aisles rest
on flat arches (made to resemble straight lintels), which run between
the caps of the main piers and the responds against the walls. The whole
construction recalls that of a castle with a large central hall roofed
with a barrel vault, and having a series of side chambers entering off
it, each covered with its separate barrel vault running at right angles
to the main building. If the partitions between these side chambers were
removed, and plain arches or lintels substituted, the construction would
be exactly that of Rosslyn Church. Such a series of chambers, with
barrel vaults running at right angles to a passage, is of common
occurrence in the ground floors of the Scottish castles. An exceptional
feature connected with the main vault of Rosslyn Church is that the same
stones which form the interior arch also form the outside roof&mdash;the
usual overlapping stone covering being omitted, possibly to avoid the
extra weight. The exterior of the roof is thus curved like the interior.</p>

<p>During the late pointed period many varieties of details were indulged
in. The buttresses are generally somewhat stunted. They are plain and
solid, and have often rather elaborate canopies and corbels for statues
placed on the front of the buttresses, without recessed niches. The
buttresses have frequently numerous set-offs, and are generally finished
with stunted square pinnacles having crocketed finials. The windows are
almost always pointed, and contain simple tracery derived from the
earlier styles. The copying of the forms of the older styles is
specially noticeable in the windows and traceries.</p>

<p>At Ladykirk, the unusual form of elliptical windows is introduced,
probably in order to admit as much light as possible at the haunches. As
above explained, there are generally no aisles, and the windows, being
kept down below the springing of the main arch, are, as usual, low, and
here leave on the exterior a high space of blank wall above them.</p>

<p>The above form of construction does not require or admit of a triforium
and clerestory. At Rosslyn, where there are side aisles, the side walls
of the choir are carried up so as to permit of clerestory windows. The
tracery is almost always set in the centre of the wall, and the same
mouldings, usually double chamfers, are repeated in the reveal both on
the inside and outside.</p>

<p>Where the choir, nave, and transepts have square ends, there is
generally a large traceried window carried up in the gable under the
barrel vault of the roof, by which the principal light in the church is
obtained.</p>

<p>The details of the late pointed churches in Scotland have comparatively
little connection with the late work either in England or France, but
some signs exist of importations from both these countries.</p>

<p>At Melrose Abbey, Linlithgow Church and Palace, and a few other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> places,
there are distinct indications of the influence of the perpendicular
style of England; while the French influence is traceable in the apsidal
terminations of the choir and occasionally of the transepts, and in some
approaches to Flamboyant tracery. The latter influence may probably have
also led to the crown-like terminations of some of the church towers. On
the whole, however, it will be found that the details of the Scottish
late pointed period are peculiar to itself, and are principally founded
on survivals and revivals of details of the earlier styles.</p>

<p>The doorways, for instance, are generally of the old, round-headed form,
with late foliage and enrichments. The common English perpendicular
doorway, with four-centred arch enclosed in a square frame, is never met
with; and although elliptical or three-centred arches occur over
doorways and windows, the four-centred arch-head is never used. Fan
tracery vaulting is also entirely absent in Scotland.</p>

<p>Porches to doorways are occasionally introduced, as at Aberdeen
Cathedral and Whitekirk; and smaller porches are formed by arches thrown
between buttresses, as at Rosslyn and Trinity College Churches.</p>

<p>Coats of arms are very commonly carved on shields at this period, and
are often useful in determining the dates of portions of the buildings,
monuments, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A tower is generally erected, or intended, over the crossing, and is
carried on the four walls, which, as we have seen, were generally built
in this position, in order to stop the four barrel vaults of the
different divisions of the church. The towers are somewhat stunted, and
they are usually finished with short, stunted spires, having a number of
lucarnes, or small dormer windows, inserted in them. The latter feature
was probably imported from France or the Low Countries, where similar
dormers abound in late work.</p>

<p>Monuments are of more common occurrence than in the earlier periods.
They are frequently placed in arched and canopied recesses, which are
ornamented with crocketed labels and finials. The carving of the
crockets and other foliage is, doubtless, founded on the conventional
perpendicular foliage of England. This, however, is mixed with a
considerable revival of carving, copied from older work.</p>

<p>The introduction of numerous small figures of men and animals is a
peculiarity of the period generally, and is found both at home and
abroad. Much of the carving of Rosslyn Church is of this description,
and similar carving may be seen at Melrose Abbey and Stirling Castle,
and on the rood screens in Glasgow Cathedral and Lincluden College.
Elaborate figure carving is common in other countries at this period, as
at Henry <small>VII.</small>’s Chapel, Westminster, and in the churches of France and
Spain.</p>

<p>Richly carved sacrament houses, such as are occasionally introduced, are
a further indication of the taste for minute sculpture which prevailed
at this time. It is not unusual to find in late buildings that some of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> smaller features, such as sedilias, piscinas, and heraldic work,
are well designed and carved with much spirit. Perhaps some of this good
carving may be due to the French masons who, we know, were numerous in
Scotland during the reigns of James <small>IV.</small> and especially of James <small>V.</small><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>During the period now under consideration, the structures chiefly
erected were, as already mentioned, either parish or collegiate
churches. A considerable number of the latter were built and endowed by
private founders during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. A list of
the collegiate churches existing in Scotland at the Reformation is given
by Dr. David Laing in his preface to <i>The Collegiate Churches of
Mid-Lothian</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> They amounted, according to that list, to thirty-eight
in number, and were spread over nearly every county in Scotland. Only
two of these had been founded in the fourteenth century, the remaining
thirty-six being all founded during the fifteenth century and the first
half of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The structures connected with a considerable number of these college
churches are more or less perfectly preserved, and these, as well as
several others not mentioned by Dr. Laing, are described in the
following pages.</p>

<p>Many of these establishments had previously existed as parish churches
or chapels before they were enlarged and made collegiate, and endowed by
the munificence of the founders.</p>

<h2><a name="PAISLEY_ABBEY_Renfrewshire" id="PAISLEY_ABBEY_Renfrewshire"></a>PAISLEY ABBEY, <span class="smcap">Renfrewshire</span>.</h2>

<p>Paisley Abbey is fortunate in having found in the Very Rev. J. Cameron
Lees, D.D., formerly one of the ministers of the parish, so able a
historian. We are largely indebted to his work, <i>The Abbey of Paisley,
1163-1878</i>, for the following historical notices.</p>

<p>The Abbey was founded by Walter, son of Alan, the High Steward of
Scotland, who had accompanied David <small>I.</small> from Shropshire, and received
lands from him in Renfrewshire. Having resolved to follow the example of
his patron, and found a monastery on his estate, Alan entered into an
agreement with Humbold, prior of Wenlock Abbey, in the native county of
his family, to establish at “Passelay” a house of the Cluniac Order of
Benedictines, being the same order as the house at Wenlock. Humbold
therefore, in 1169, brought thirteen monks from the parent house, and,
having settled them in Renfrewshire on an island of the Clyde called the
King’s Inch, returned to Wenlock. There would at that time appear to
have been a very ancient church in existence at Paisley, dedicated to
St. Mirinus, an Irish saint of the sixth century, who had been a
disciple of the great school of St. Comgal at Bangor. A new monastery
was now to supersede the establishment of St. Mirin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span> but the name of
the ancient saint was preserved in the dedication of the abbey.</p>

<p>It was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin; to St. James, the patron saint
of the Stewarts; to St. Milburga, the patron of the monks of Wenlock;
and to St. Mirinus, the Celtic missionary of the locality. The monastery
was at first established as a priory; but, in 1245, it was raised to the
rank of an abbey by Pope Honorius <small>III.</small></p>

<p>The establishment was well endowed, and during the first half of the
thirteenth century it was thoroughly consolidated under Abbot William,
who presided from 1225 to 1248. During the prosperous reigns of Kings
Alexander II. and III. the church was erected, but of the work of that
period (the thirteenth century) there remain only a portion of the west
front and part of the south wall of the nave, including the south-east
doorway to the cloister, and three windows. The structure appears to
have suffered severely during the War of Independence. It stood in the
vicinity of Elderslie, the lands of Sir William Wallace, and doubtless
met with a similar savage treatment to that allotted to the patriot
leader. It is stated to have been burnt by the English in 1307, and the
burning would appear to have led to a very complete destruction of the
edifice, as the portions of the original work which survive are very
small.</p>

<p>The connection of the Stewart family with the abbey continued till,
through the marriage of Walter with Margery, daughter of Robert the
Bruce, the Stewarts succeeded to the throne. The earlier Stewarts were
all buried in the abbey, which also contains the tomb of Robert <small>III.</small></p>

<p>In consequence of the destruction of the monastery, caused by the wars
with England, the buildings long remained, like other structures in
Scotland at that period, in a dismantled condition; but gifts having
been received from the Bishops of Argyle and Glasgow to aid the monks in
their distress, and to assist in restoring the fabric, operations were
begun. Part of this work was apparently carried out by Bishop Lithgow
(1384-1433), who was buried, by his own desire, in the north porch,
where the inscription to his memory is still preserved. The chief part,
however, of the rebuilding of the Abbey Church was carried out under
Abbot Thomas de Tervas (1445-1459). This abbot obtained the privilege of
having a tavern and selling wine within the gates of the monastery, and
is believed to have raised money thereby for the reconstruction of the
church. According to the ancient chronicle of Auchenleck, he found the
place in ruin and the “kirk unbiggit.” He carried up the triforium and
clerestory, and finished the roof. He also erected a great portion of
the steeple, and built a stately gatehouse. Having completed the
building of the church, he proceeded to Rome, in order there to procure
suitable furnishings, and brought back adornments of sumptuous
character&mdash;jewels, cloths of gold and silver, precious books, the
“statliest Tabernkle in al Scotland,” and “ane lettren of brass.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span></p>

<p>During the fifteenth century many altars were erected and endowed by the
burgesses, and the Chapel of St. Mirin, which occupies part of the site
of the south transept, was erected in 1499, and endowed by James
Crawford of Kylwynet, a burgess of Paisley, and his wife.</p>

<p>At the decease of Abbot Tervas, Pope Pius <small>II.</small> decreed that the
disposition of the office of abbot and of the whole revenues of the
monastery should fall to the Pope. A commendator thus came to be
appointed, and the rights of the abbey began to be invaded. However,
Abbot George Shaw (1472-1498) endeavoured to guard the possessions of
the monastery from encroachments. He also succeeded in having the
village of the abbey erected into a burgh, with the usual privileges.
Abbot Shaw likewise improved the buildings of the abbey. He erected a
refectory and other structures, and reared a lofty tower over the
principal gate, and enclosed the grounds and gardens of the convent with
a wall of ashlar, about one mile in circuit, and adorned it with statues
and shields.</p>

<p>Abbot Shaw placed his arms on several parts of this wall, and in the
middle of the north portion he inserted three shields&mdash;the central one
bearing the royal arms; that on the right the Stewart arms, for the
founder; and that on the left the abbot’s own arms. He also erected a
tablet on the north-west angle, containing his name and the date of
erection. Only a small portion of this wall remains, but the panels
containing the royal arms and the inscription are preserved in the
Coates Museum. The latter is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div>

<p>Mr. Chalmers<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is of opinion that this inscription was designed by John
Morow, whose name appears on a tablet at Melrose Abbey.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “The
character of the lettering in design and workmanship is the same as at
Melrose. The references to the building operations, the poetical form of
the compositions, the manner in which the names are introduced&mdash;‘Callit
was I,’ and ‘ye Callit’&mdash;and the devout expressions with which they
close, make it clear that the inscriptions are the work of the same
author.” Whether that is so, or whether the inscriptions simply reflect
the style, both literary and artistic, of the period is questionable. In
any case, the idea is ingenious. Mr. Chalmers points out that the fifth
line, which is erased, was probably cut out by the Reformers, as being
out of keeping with their religious views, while the remainder indicates
the care with which the historically valuable part was preserved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span></p>

<p>The days of Abbot John Hamilton (1525-1544), who became Bishop of
Dunkeld, and was afterwards promoted to be Archbishop of St. Andrews,
were evil for the monastery of Paisley, as for all other similar
institutions in the country. When driven from St. Andrews, the
archbishop sought safety at Paisley; but that house being sacked and
burnt by the Reformers, he had to take refuge at Dumbarton Castle, where
he was made prisoner, and afterwards executed at Stirling.</p>

<p>The Master of Sempill had been appointed bailie of the monastery, and,
at the dissolution, the whole of the church property was handed over to
Lord Sempill. The property finally came into the possession of Lord
Claud Hamilton, nephew of the archbishop, and the monastic buildings
were converted into the “Place of Paisley,” the residence of the
Abercorn family.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Before the Reformation the monastery consisted of the church, the
cloister, and the conventual buildings. The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_953">953</a>) comprised
a long aisleless choir, a nave with aisles, a north transept, a south
transept, with St. Mirin’s Chapel attached to the south of it, and a
tower and spire over the crossing.</p>

<p>The choir can still be traced, as the walls remain standing to the
height of 9 feet, and contain an elegant sedilia and piscina. The choir
measures, internally, about 124 feet in length by 22 feet in width. It
may be questioned whether the choir was ever finished during the
restoration. The walls present rather the appearance of having been
abandoned at a certain stage in the progress of their erection than of a
building which had fallen into ruin. They stand at a uniform level,
marked by a string course all round, and have not the irregular heights
generally found in ruins. The building is of fifteenth century work, and
doubtless occupies the place of an earlier choir, which had been
demolished.</p>

<p>The wall at the east end of the nave, which separates it from the
transept, is of a substantial kind, and may have been erected when the
structure was restored in the fifteenth century, with the intention of
rendering the nave a complete church, until the transept and choir were
restored. The latter seems never to have been carried into effect, but
to have been in progress when all work was interrupted by the
Reformation.</p>

<p>There are no indications at the junction of the choir and transept of
the large piers which would naturally be built so as to correspond with
those at the west side of the crossing (Fig. <a href="#fig_954">954</a>). The fine sedilia,
although greatly mutilated (Fig. <a href="#fig_955">955</a>), is the principal feature in the
eastern part of the edifice. It is 11 feet 2 inches long, and contains
four seats, contrary to the usual practice, which is to have three
seats. The design is elegant, and resembles that of the sedilia at St.
Monan’s, Fifeshire. Adjoining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> sedilia is the piscina, the basin of
which is broken, but the aperture is still visible. The recess, which
has an angled head, slopes backwards.</p>

</div>

<p>In this respect it resembles one at Auchterarder. On each side are two
small recesses, about 12 inches wide, for holding the sacred vessels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12"
id="page_12">{12}</a></span></p>

<p>The north transept (see Fig. <a href="#fig_954">954</a>) is in ruins, but the north wall, with
the remains of a fine traceried window (Fig. <a href="#fig_956">956</a>), still exists, as well
as a traceried window in the west wall. These traceries were restored a
few years ago. The mode in which the turrets at the angles above the
buttresses are corbelled out recalls similar features at Dunkeld
Cathedral. These turrets resemble the roofed bartizans of castellated
structures.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 954.</span>&mdash;Paisley Abbey. Junction of Nave with North
Transept.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The south transept is also in ruins, and the tower and spire have
disappeared. The Chapel of St. Mirin, however, is still well preserved,
but the openings connecting it with the south transept have been built
up.</p>

<p>The nave is the only part of the main divisions of the church which
survives as a whole. It measures, internally, 92 feet in length by 60
feet in width, and contains six bays, divided by massive piers, all
surmounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span> by a triforium and clerestory. There is a porch on the north
side and two doorways from the cloister on the south side.</p>

<p>The oldest portion of the building is, undoubtedly, the eastern part of
the south wall of the south aisle of the nave, where it adjoins the
transept. This portion of wall consists of three bays (Fig. <a href="#fig_957">957</a>),
containing the south-east doorway from the cloister to the nave, and
three pointed windows in the upper part. The doorway is of the
transition style, having a round arch-head, with numerous bold mouldings
springing from carved and foliaged</p>

<p class="nind">caps with square abaci (Fig. <a href="#fig_958">958</a>). The windows above are very simple in
style, and are apparently early first pointed work. This part of the
building probably dates from the first half of the thirteenth century.
The western portion of the south aisle of the nave (Fig. <a href="#fig_959">959</a>) and the
whole of the south clerestory (see Figs. <a href="#fig_957">957</a> and <a href="#fig_959">959</a>)) are evidently
portions of the restored church of the fifteenth century. The south
aisle wall contains the south-west and south-east doors from the nave to

<p>The west end of the nave (Fig. <a href="#fig_960">960</a>) is also in part amongst the ancient
portions of the structure. The western entrance doorway is clearly, from
the style of its architecture, a work of the thirteenth century. The

<p class="nind">projects, and has a nook shaft on the projecting angles. The doorway is
a single pointed opening, deeply recessed, with a series of free shafts
in the jambs, having rounded and moulded caps, and the arch mouldings
are arranged in square orders. The outer order contains a dog-tooth
ornament. A sharply pointed arch flanks the doorway on each side, and
has similar shafts and mouldings to those of the central opening. The
aisle windows of the west front also belong to the first pointed period.
The thin nook shafts, with moulded caps having round abaci and central
bands, are all in the style of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The upper portion of the west front above the two large windows is
undoubtedly of considerably later date. The design of the west front,
which contains above the doorpiece two large windows, with pointed
niches and small circles inserted between the arch-heads, is probably
original, but the upper portion and gable, including the large traceried
window, are doubtless part of the restoration of the fifteenth century.
The tracery of the two central windows is peculiar, and may possibly be
of the fourteenth century, but that of the large upper window is later,
probably of the same period as the restoration of the interior of the
nave. The tracery of the large upper window is a specimen of the late
kind of design employed in Scotland in the fifteenth century. The change
of style caused by the restoration of the fifteenth century is well
marked in the interior at the west end of the nave. The first or western
bay of the main arcade is original (Figs. <a href="#fig_961">961</a> and <a href="#fig_962">962</a>), including the
first arches (one on each side), the first pillars and the arches
between them, and the aisle responds. These pillars and arches are of
large dimensions and first pointed section (Fig. <a href="#fig_963">963</a>), and appear to
have been designed to carry western towers, but a part of their
thickness has been cut off next the choir. A portion of the triforium
wall, a piece of the string course over the main arcade, and the
corbelled vaulting shaft in the angle as high as the top of the
triforium, are also parts of the original structure. The later work has
been joined to the above old parts in a very awkward manner. The wall
over the large pillars has been thinned on the side next the nave, and
the different width and sections of the mouldings have not been properly
adjusted, the result being that part of the older moulding is left at
the springing of the second arch on the north side, and the mouldings of
the later section are butted against it (see Fig. <a href="#fig_961">961</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p class="nind">angle beside the original one as high as the triforium arch and there
stops. The first triforium arch, which is pointed (all the others being
round), abuts against the wall in an awkward manner (see Fig. <a href="#fig_961">961</a>), the
original design being changed.</p>

<p>The cap of the west pier on the north side belongs to the first pointed
work, while the corresponding cap on the south side (see Fig. <a href="#fig_962">962</a>) and
all the other caps belong to the restoration of the fifteenth century.
The above cap and all the later caps in the nave have the upper
mouldings run in a straight line without any break, while the lower
mouldings break round the section of the piers (Fig. <a href="#fig_964">964</a>).<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> A moulded
shaft, considerably off the perpendicular, rises from the top of the
above cap to the string course at the junction of the old and the
restored wall.</p>

<p>The piers of the nave, except the west piers, are of a clustered form
not uncommon in late work in Scotland. The caps and main arches have
good mouldings, and might be about the date of the restoration of St.
Giles’, Edinburgh (which they resemble), in the early part of the
fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The design of the triforium is very remarkable (see Figs. <a href="#fig_961">961</a> and <a href="#fig_962">962</a>)),
consisting of large segmental arches the same width as the main arches,
springing from short clustered piers introduced between them. Each arch
is filled in with two pointed arches resting on a smaller central shaft.
These arches and the spandril between them are treated with bold
cusping.</p>

<p>The triforium of the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral somewhat resembles that
at Paisley Abbey. It contains a series of semicircular openings filled
with similar pointed arches and cusping, but the work at Paisley is
superior, and would appear to be the earlier of the two. In neither
church is there any vaulting shaft to divide the bays.</p>

<p>The clerestory is probably designed in imitation of that of Glasgow
Cathedral. It is divided into two pointed arches in each bay. These
spring from a series of clustered shafts with round moulded caps, which
have an early character, but are evidently late imitations of early
work. The exterior views (see Figs. <a href="#fig_957">957</a> and <a href="#fig_959">959</a>)) show that each
clerestory window contains a central shaft, with two cusped arches and
quatrefoil in the arch-head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<p>The parapets of the nave and nave aisles are evidently, from the style
of the mouldings and ornaments, of late date.</p>

<p>There seems to be no reason to doubt that, as above stated, the upper
portions of the nave were carried out about the time of Bishop Tervas,
in the middle of the fifteenth century. The earlier part of the
restoration, including the main piers and arches, and perhaps the
tracery of the two lower windows of the west front, were possibly
executed by Bishop</p>

<p>Lithgow, who built the north porch, and the completion of the nave was
carried out by Bishop Tervas. A striking peculiarity of the interior of
the nave is a series of large corbels (see Figs. <a href="#fig_961">961</a> and <a href="#fig_962">962</a>)), which
project from the spandrils of the triforium arcade. The object of these
corbels appears to have been to enable a passage, which is formed in the
interior of the clerestory windows, but does not run through the wall in
a straight line from end to end as is usual, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span> carried round the
solid piers introduced between the windows. These projections recall, by
the small corbels arranged in rows into which they are divided, the
corbels generally used for the support of the bartizans of castles. Each
of the large corbels springs at its lowest point from the sculptured
grotesque figure of a man or animal. Dr. Lees states (p. 209) that these
figures “were mostly the work of Thomas Hector, a sculptor who lived at
Crossflat, and whom the abbot retained for his skill in his art.” One of
the corbels on the south side (near the west end) represents a man
wearing the garb of Old Gaul. It may be mentioned that a somewhat
similar gallery exists in Rouen Cathedral. It is carried round the piers
of the nave on the side next the aisles, and is supported on shafts
springing from corbels. This gallery has a light stone parapet resting
on it. The design is of the thirteenth century, and is elegantly carried
out; but it has, notwithstanding, a rather heavy appearance. It must be
admitted that the projecting corbels at Paisley are clumsy, and
considerably mar the effect of the interior. There appears to have been
a parapet in front of the clerestory passage opposite the windows, and a
similar parapet may have been carried round the large corbels, otherwise
walking round them would have been dangerous. This would add still more
to the heaviness of their appearance. Vaulting shafts are carried up
between the windows of the clerestory, but the buttresses being very
light, a vaulted roof has apparently not been contemplated. The present
plaster vaulting is modern. The north wall of the nave aisle, except the
doorway of the north porch, which is of first pointed work, has been
rebuilt in the fifteenth century. The ingoing of the window jambs and
arches consists, both on the inside and outside of the wall, of a great
hollow, with the tracery set in the centre of the wall. The large north
porch (shown in Billings’ work) was taken down in 1863, in order to be
erected anew, in what was considered a finer style. The porch contains
the tomb of Bishop Lithgow, who selected this porch as his burial-place,
and was interred there in 1433. Some of the tracery in the aisle windows
is good for the period, like that in some of the windows of Dunkeld
Cathedral, which building (as above mentioned) has considerable affinity
with Paisley Abbey Church.</p>

<p>St. Mirin’s Aisle (Fig. <a href="#fig_965">965</a>), as already pointed out, occupies the south
end of the south transept, and was erected in 1499. It is a chapel 48
feet 3 inches long by 23 feet wide, having a vaulted roof about 32 feet
6 inches high. The main vault, like that of so many structures of the
latter part of the fifteenth century, consists of a pointed barrel
vault, the curve of which is drawn from a point lower than the springing
of the arch, and thus forms an angle at the junction with the side
walls. The surface of the vault is strengthened with a series of ribs,
most of which spring from corbels in the side walls. The ribs are
arranged so as to cross one another at the ridge, as if the roof were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">groined; but they are almost entirely ornamental. The mouldings of the
corbels are well designed, and show an imitation of first pointed work.
The corbels being at a lower level than the top of the wall, the ribs
project considerably in passing that point. The ridge has a bold rib
enriched with carved bosses, and one of the transverse ribs is divided
into two branches, so as to avoid descending on the top of the large
arch in the north wall. There is a large pointed window in the east end,
having jambs with single shafts (like the clerestory of the church). It
has mullions dividing it into four lights, and the arch-head is filled
with good simple tracery. Beneath this window runs a frieze 1 foot 8
inches broad, partly carved, with groups of figures showing, as
discovered by Dr. Lees,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> events in the life of St. Mirin. The east
end of the chapel, where the altar stood, is raised four steps above the
western part. The west wall contains an outer doorway from the cloister
court, and there is a window with simple tracery above it; a curious
large ambry adjoins the door in the outer wall. The chapel was connected
with the south transept by two wide archways, now built up. There is a
piscina near the east end (Fig. <a href="#fig_966">966</a>), with three-sided head, like that
in the choir.</p>

<p>Above the vaulting of St. Mirin’s Chapel, and in the angle formed by the
sloping roof, there is introduced a chamber, with a pointed barrel
vault, about 12 feet wide and nearly 10 feet high, to the apex of its
sharply pointed vault. The three sides of this chamber thus nearly form
an equilateral triangle. Like the chapel below, it is 48 feet in length.
It is lighted by trefoil headed windows in the gables. Access to this
chamber, which may have been occupied by one or more priests, is
obtained from the adjoining buildings. It is to be regretted that the
south and south-east sides of St. Mirin’s Chapel are concealed from view
by buildings of a poor description. It will be observed that the
construction of the roof of St. Mirin’s bears considerable analogy with
that of Lincluden Abbey, although later in its features. There is a
similar double vault over both these buildings, with a small chamber
between them. At Lincluden the lower vault was (if it ever was
completed) of a genuine groined construction, while at St. Mirin’s the
ribs were only imitative. The roof of St. Mirin’s Chapel was clearly
intended to be formed of stone slabs, resting on the pointed arch, but
has never been carried out, the present roof being slated.</p>

<p>On the floor of this chapel there now stands an ornamental altar tomb
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_965">965</a>), which was found lying in fragments near the abbey by Dr.
Boog, one of the ministers of the parish, who, in 1817, had it brought
here and put together again. It supports a recumbent female figure,
believed to be the effigy of Margery, daughter of King Robert <small>I.</small>, and
mother of Robert <small>II.</small> The head of the figure is surmounted by a large
cusped canopy, placed in n horizontal position, on the end of which is
carved a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> crucifixion. The pedestal is covered with a series of Gothic
compartments, in each of which there is carved a shield, enriched with
heraldic blazons and figures of ecclesiastics. The panels at the west
end (Fig. <a href="#fig_967">967</a>) contain&mdash;the first the fess chequé of the Stewarts
between three roses; the third the fess chequé, surmounted of a lion
rampant, and the central one, two keys saltierwise, between two crosiers
in pale.</p>

<p>Mr. Semple<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> is of opinion that the monument is made up of fragments
from various quarters. On each side there are nine full compartments of</p>

<p class="nind">an oblong or oval form, and one half compartment at each end. At the
foot the compartments are empty. On the right side the 1st compartment
contains a bishop with crosier; the 4th, a bishop at prayer, and, on a
scroll, the name Robert Wyshart (Bishop of Glasgow). On the left, the
1st compartment contains a bishop celebrating, with the name Johes D.
Lychtgow (Abbot of Paisley); the 4th, an abbot at prayer, with the name
of Abbot Lythgow repeated. Several compartments contain monks at prayer,
and others are blank. Mr. Semple thinks that the left side may be part
of Abbot Lithgow’s monument, and the right side part of that of Bishop
Wishart.</p>

<p>Of the cloisters and conventual buildings few traces remain; but the
outline of the cloister court is preserved. It is surrounded (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_953">953</a>) with post-Reformation structures, occupying the site of the chapter
house, refectory, &amp;c. These were converted into the “place of Paisley,”
as the residence of the Abercorn family, which has been already fully
described.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> These buildings probably contain portions of the walls of
the refectory and other conventual structures erected by Abbot Shaw at
the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> the fifteenth century. The western side of the cloister
buildings was removed about twenty years ago, in order to widen the
adjoining street. The wall, gatehouse, &amp;c., erected by Abbot Shaw, have
now almost entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>The cloistral buildings were much altered and added to in 1675 by the
Earl of Dundonald, and fitted up as a mansion house, and they still bear
traces of considerable splendour in panelled walls, with stone
fireplaces and ornamental ceilings. One of the latter on the upper floor
is a fine example of the plaster and painted decoration of the period.</p>

<p>Turning to the ground Plan, it seems highly probable that the walls are,
in part at least, of pre-Reformation date, and that we have here</p>

Mirin’s Chapel.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">part of the work of Abbot Shaw, who erected a refectory and other
buildings at the end of the fifteenth century. It will be observed that
the main wall of the south range, running east and west, is very thick
(4 feet to 5 feet), while the outside wall, forming the south side of
the cloister, is only about 2 feet thick. The latter was probably
erected when the place became a mansion house, in order to form a
passage, and thus obviate the necessity of passing through the rooms,
while the thick wall was the original outside wall of the refectory or
of cellars below it. The south wall of this building also probably
consists in part of the south wall of the refectory, but the large
windows in it are, doubtless, insertions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<p>The building marked as chapter house on the Plan occupies the position
in which that chamber would likely be. It is now divided into two, and
has lost all traces of its ecclesiastical purpose&mdash;one side being used
as a bottling store and the other as a stable. There is a large
fireplace in the north wall, of distinctly Gothic design. That is not a
usual feature in a chapter house; but in the sacristy over the chapter
house of Glasgow Cathedral there is a large fireplace. At Paisley, the
arrangement may have been reversed. The vestry may have been on the
ground floor and the chapter house above. This building is at present
some five stories in height, the upper floors being reached by the wheel
stair shown on the Plan. It is from this high building that the chamber
over St. Mirin’s is reached, which is a fair indication that this
chapter house tower, as it may be called, is as old as St. Mirin’s. The
same stair also accommodates the refectory range of buildings on the
south side of the cloister, which are three stories in height, and have
another stair at the west end.</p>

<p>It is thought by some that the first central tower erected over the
crossing was of inferior workmanship and gave way. Another central tower
is believed to have been erected by Abbot Tervas. This tower probably
fell during the siege by Lennox and Glencairn, no doubt destroying much
of the choir and transept in its fall. It has been mentioned above that
western towers appear to have been contemplated. Possibly it may be one
of these to which Martine, when speaking of John Hamilton, Archbishop of
St. Andrews, refers when he says, “At which church [Paisley] he built a
prettie handsome steeple, which fell before it was well finished.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>It is thought that the body of Archbishop Hamilton was buried in the
abbey, and a tablet in the church looks as if it marked his grave. It
contains his arms and initials, J. H., and “the motto he assumed, which
contrasts strangely with his troubled life, ‘Misericordia et pax.’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p>

<p>Several monuments with inscriptions of sixteenth century date exist in
the building. On the west buttress of the north transept, at 21 feet in
height, is the shield of the Stewarts, with a pastoral staff and the
word “Stewart.”</p>

<p>One of the south piers of the nave is called the Cathcart pillar, having
carved upon it a shield with the Cathcart arms (see Fig. <a href="#fig_964">964</a>). This is
believed to be a memorial of Sir Allan Cathcart, one of the knights who
sailed for the Holy Land with Bruce’s heart. The heart was brought back
by Sir Allan, and buried at Melrose.</p>

<h2><a name="DUNKELD_CATHEDRAL_Perthshire" id="DUNKELD_CATHEDRAL_Perthshire"></a>DUNKELD CATHEDRAL, <span class="smcap">Perthshire</span>.</h2>

<p>Situated in the beautiful, though rugged, glen which forms the pass to
the Highlands from the fertile lowlands of Perthshire, this grey and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span>
venerable ruin adds an unexpected and charming interest to the lovely
scenery of the locality. The mountain range through which the pass
penetrates long formed a barrier to the access of the Scottish kings to
the Celtic provinces further north, and the nearness of the Highland
clans was a constant source of menace to the Church. For that reason the
bishop’s palace had to be constructed as a fortified stronghold; hence,
perhaps, the name of Dunkeld, the fort of the Keledei or Culdees.</p>

<p>After the destruction of Iona by the Norsemen in the beginning of the
ninth century, Dunkeld was selected by the King of the Picts as a secure
place, remote from the sea, and comparatively safe from the attacks of
the Vikings, in which a mother church in lieu of Iona might be
established. To this retreat a portion of the relics of Columba were
brought by King Kenneth Macalpine in 850, and here he resolved to place
the abbot of his new monastery as bishop over the Church in the
territories of the Southern Picts, with a view to the ready
reorganisation of the Scottish monasteries, so that they should form one
diocese under one bishop.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>But the primacy of the Pictish Church did not remain long at Dunkeld,
being transferred in the end of the ninth century to Abernethy, on the
south side of the Frith of Tay.</p>

<p>The abbots in those days had become great lay proprietors, having lawful
wives, and succeeding to the benefices of their abbacies by hereditary
descent. One of these lay abbots of Dunkeld married a daughter of
Malcolm <small>II.</small>, and it is remarkable that it was by their descendants that
the religious order in Scotland was changed. The new order of things,
which had been initiated by St. Margaret, was continued by her son,
Alexander <small>I.</small>, who, in 1107, created two new bishoprics in the more
remote and Celtic portion of his kingdom, the first being that of Moray,
and the second that of Dunkeld. Alexander <small>I.</small> also brought, in 1115, a
body of canons regular to Scone Abbey, and a few years later he
established the same order in the diocese of Dunkeld. He also, in 1122,
introduced canons regular to a monastery he had built on an island in
Loch Tay, and, in 1123, founded the monastery of Inchcolm, and
introduced the same order there.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The Cathedral of Dunkeld has been the see of several distinguished
bishops. Bruce’s friend and supporter, Bishop Sinclair, held this see;
and Gavin Douglas, the well-known scholar and translator of the <i>Æneid
of Virgil</i>, was Bishop of Dunkeld.</p>

<p>The buildings which now exist are of much more recent date than the days
of Queen Margaret’s sons. Alexander Myln, a canon of Dunkeld in 1505,
and afterwards Abbot of Cambuskenneth and first President of the College
of Justice, has fortunately left a history of the lives of the Bishops
of Dunkeld, which professes to give a more minute account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">dates of the different parts of the structure of the cathedral than we
have of any similar building in the country. From this account it would
appear that the existing structure is chiefly of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The edifice (Fig. <a href="#fig_968">968</a>) consists of an aisleless choir, a nave with two
aisles, a north-west tower, and a chapter house to the north of the
choir. The choir measures 103 feet long by 29 feet wide internally, and
the rectangular chapter house attached to the north side is 27 feet long
and 20 feet wide. Some portions of the choir indicate the style of the
thirteenth</p>

<p class="nind">century; but this part of the structure was almost entirely rebuilt in
the beginning of the present century. An original fragment may, however,
still be observed in damaged portions of a first pointed arcade (Fig.
<a href="#fig_969">969</a>) in the interior of the north wall near the west end. The arcade is
below the level of the window sill, and extends to six arches of trefoil
form, springing from the carved caps of single shafts. All the details
(Fig. <a href="#fig_970">970</a>) are pure and good. A post to support a modern gallery cuts
into the arcade, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_969">969</a>. From the floor to the top of the
caps<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> measures 5 feet 9 inches. The choir is now fitted up and used as
the parish church.</p>

<p>The chapter house, on the north side of the choir, is now converted into
a mausoleum for the families of the Dukes of Atholl, and contains
several Renaissance monuments. It is two stories high (Fig. <a href="#fig_971">971</a>), the</p>

lighted by tall lancet windows cusped at the arch head. The buttresses
are simple, and the whole character of the work is early, but it has
been altered. The vaulting (Fig. <a href="#fig_972">972</a>) is round arched, but the wall ribs
are pointed; the roof has thus a flat appearance, and there are no
horizontal<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> ridge ribs. The chapter house structure has been added after
the erection of the choir, as is evident from the portion of the
original exterior base of the choir which still exists in the south-west
angle of the interior of the chapter house adjoining the door (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_972">972</a>). From the style of the design, this structure was probably an early
addition. The upper</p>

and Renaissance features, frequently found in the seventeenth century.

arranged in two rows of eight on each side, besides other arms.</p>

<p>Resting on the floor, and against the walls of the chapter house, there
are numerous carved stones, several having arms, which appear to have
come from some sixteenth or seventeenth century buildings; and in the

<p>Abbot Myln relates<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> that in 1312 Bishop William de St. Clare (Bruce’s
“own bishop”) brought Magistrum Robertum Cementarium to the work of the
choir and church, which he built from the foundation. This clearly
refers to a restoration, as part of the thirteenth century walls is
still in existence. Bishop Sinclair died in 1337, and was buried in the
choir built by him, having filled the see for twenty-five years.</p>

<p>To the west of the choir is the nave, which measures, internally, 120
feet in length by 60 feet wide, and consists of a central compartment of
seven bays, separated from the side aisles by arcades, which rest on
plain round pillars. We are informed by Abbot Mylne that this part of
the cathedral was founded by Bishop Cardeny on the 27th day of April
1406, and that he carried it up to the second arches, “vulgariter le
blynd storijs.” This bishop conferred great benefits on the see by
acquiring lands for it and otherwise. He also founded and adorned the
altar of St. Ninian in Dunkeld, and decorated all the windows of the
choir with glass. Having on one occasion made a narrow escape during an
attack on his house, he constructed a strong tower for the bishop’s
residence. He died in 1436,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and his fine monument (Fig. <a href="#fig_975">975</a>) is
still preserved in the south wall of the nave.</p>

<p>In 1447 the king’s secretary, John of Ralstoun, was made bishop, but he
lived for only three years after his appointment.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> He made provision
of hewn stones from the quarry of Burnbane for continuing the building
of the nave begun by Bishop Cardeny. Bishop Ralston died in 1450, and
was succeeded by Bishop Lauder, who completed the nave and decorated all
the windows with glass, and finished the roof. He also constructed a
handsome portico to the church before the southern doorway, and placed
figures of sculptured art therein. With his own hands Bishop Lauder
dedicated the church in 1464. But still untired of his sacred work, he
founded the campanile (Fig. <a href="#fig_976">976</a>) on 5th March 1469, and continued the
building on high. The chapter house was also founded by him in 1457.
This, no doubt, refers to the erection of the upper floor of the two
story building on the north side of the choir above described. Perhaps
this edifice contained the sacristy on the ground floor, on the level of
the choir, and the upper story added by Bishop Lauder may have been the
chapter house. At Glasgow Cathedral, the similar two story building
contained the sacristy on the upper floor, on the level of the choir,
and the chapter house on the lower story. This “Great and worthy High
Priest” likewise, in 1461, constructed a bridge over the Tay, near his
own palace, partly of stone and partly of wood. He likewise presented
the church with numerous splendid vestments and silver vessels,
including a silver cross containing part of the true Cross. He also had
paintings executed at the high altar, representing the twenty-four
miracles of St. Columba, and he constructed the bishop’s throne and
stalls in the choir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span></p>

<p>In 1481 this prelate died full of years and of good works. By Bishop
Lauder’s influence the cathedral lands north of the Forth were raised
into</p>

<p>The bishops of Dunkeld, in addition to their palace or tower at Dunkeld,
had also a country seat at Loch Cluny (where their house still exists on
an island in the loch) and a residence at Cramond, in Mid-Lothian.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The successors of Bishop Lauder are not stated to have added any
buildings to the cathedral; but it is mentioned that some of them,
especially Bishop Brown, adorned the interior with images and paintings,
and added to the store of rich vestments and ornaments.</p>

<p>The Reformation came not long after the completion of the internal
decorations and fittings. In 1560 two of the neighbouring lairds were
commissioned to take down the images and burn them in the churchyard,
and also to cast down the altars and purge the church of all kinds of
monuments of idolatry. They were enjoined to see that the desks,
windows, and doors were unharmed, nor the glass or iron work broken. But
the spirit of destruction once let loose was not easily restrained, and
the church was completely destroyed and the roof burnt.</p>

<p>The architectural style of the different portions of the edifice
corresponds generally with the above dates fixed by Abbot Myln. The
massive round pillars of the nave, 4 feet 6 inches in diameter (Fig.
<a href="#fig_977">977</a>), and the heavy semicircular arches of the triforium have been
supposed to indicate Norman work; but the details prove that here, as
frequently occurs in Scotland, the ancient forms are repeated in later
times. The caps and bases of the piers show that they belong to an
advanced period, while the mouldings of the triforium arches and the
trefoiled filling in clearly indicate work of the latter half of the
fifteenth century. These features are, undoubtedly, peculiar; but other
examples show that they are not singular. Thus at Aberdour Church<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and Aberdeen Cathedral (late works), the pillars of the piers are
circular, and have similar caps to those at Dunkeld; and at Paisley the
triforium arches are segmental, and are divided with cusped arches
somewhat similar in style to those of Dunkeld Cathedral. The clerestory
is very plain, and the windows are small. From the number of holes in
the wall, used for the support of rafters and other woodwork, it seems
likely that this portion of the wall was partly concealed by the timbers
of the open wooden roof, and perhaps partly covered with panelling.</p>

<p>The great window in the western gable (see Fig. <a href="#fig_976">976</a>) is evidently a late
feature, and seems to have been added sometime after the west wall had
been erected. This is apparent not only from the style and the peculiar
unsymmetrical position of the window, but also from the construction of
the exterior (Fig. <a href="#fig_978">978</a>), where it will be observed that the original
west door has had a portion of wall somewhat rudely added in front of
the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> wall, in order to support a balcony or gallery carried
across at the base of the window. The older moulded doorway (the jamb of
which is shown in</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">(Fig. <a href="#fig_973">973</a>) is thus overlapped and buried by two square piers, carrying
plain arches above, stuck on in front of the original wall; while in a
similar opening or recess, between the south pier and the tower at the</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 978.</span>&mdash;Dunkeld Cathedral. West End.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">south side, the space is lintelled over between the square pier and the
stair turret. As the stair turret probably existed (at least for part of
its height) before this alteration, the large window, which occupies the
full available width, had to be squeezed in as best it could, and thus
came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span> stand in the unsymmetrical position it occupies (see Fig. <a href="#fig_977">977</a>).
This supposed alteration may also, perhaps, explain the peculiar way in
which the ogee canopy of the window is twisted to one side at the top
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_976">976</a>), which Mr. Billings has difficulty in accounting for. The
small circle in the gable being right over the entrance door (as the
original window in the west end doubtless also was), it was found, when
the window came to be enlarged, that there was no room to carry the
canopy and its fleur-de-lys finial straight up without removing the
small circular opening, and so the canopy and finial had to be pushed to
one side.</p>

<p>The side aisles are 12 feet in width, and the south one has been
vaulted. The tracery in many of the windows still survives, and is
varied and generally good in design. A restoration of the tracery in the
west window may be seen in Mr. Billings’ work. The tracery is of the
kind common in the Scottish architecture of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Attention has already been drawn to the peculiar flat-headed windows at
the west end of the north aisle of Dunblane Cathedral. At Dunkeld, the
corresponding window is flat arched (Fig. <a href="#fig_979">979</a>), and at St. John’s
Church, in Perth, the window in the same position is either flat arched
or has a lintel. It is singular and interesting to find this similarity
of treatment, as regards the north-west window, in these three churches,
which are all situated in one part of the country. Over the north-west
window at Dunkeld are the arms of Bishop Brown (a chevron between three
fleur-de-lys), surmounted by a mitre. There is an inscription on a
ribbon round the arms, but it would require a very minute inspection to
make it out. George Brown was consecrated Bishop of Dunkeld by Pope
Sixtus IV. in 1484, and died 14th January 1514-1515, aged seventy-six
years.</p>

<p>The ruins of a large porch still exist on the south side of the nave
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_976">976</a>). From the forms of the finials and other details it has
evidently been a somewhat late addition. This was, doubtless, the
portico which Canon Myln states was erected by Bishop Lauder at the
south entrance to the church.</p>

<p>The upper part of the stair turret of the west front, the broken angle
pinnacle at the base of the gable, and the corbelled octagonal finial on
the south-west angle of the south aisle are all late additions. The
corbelled turret at the angle resembles the angle turrets of the
castles. A similar turret exists at the angle of the north transept of
Paisley Abbey.</p>

<p>The north-west tower is simple and good in design. According to Abbot
Myln’s account, it was not founded till 1469, and in style is good for
the period. The windows of the ground floor and top story are well
designed, and quite equal to the rest of the church. The ground floor is
vaulted, and has been painted in a handsome manner, part of the painting
being still preserved.</p>

canopy, is a good example of Scottish work of the fifteenth century. It

<p>A very fine altar tomb (Fig. <a href="#fig_980">980</a>) still remains in the south side of the
eastern part of the choir, now used as a vestibule to the parish church.
This is the monument of the famous “Wolf of Badenoch,” son of Robert
<small>II.</small>, at one time a great enemy to the Church, and the destroyer of Elgin
Cathedral. Having been compelled by the king to do penance, he received
absolution at the hands of the Archbishop of St. Andrews, in the</p>

<p>Blackfriars Church, at Perth. The monument dates from about 1394. It
contains a massive figure of the “Wolf” in complete armour, with his
feet resting on a lion. On the sarcophagus are carved a number of
figures in armour, in different attitudes.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> There is a mutilated
headless figure, supposed to represent Bishop Sinclair, lying beside the
“Wolf of Badenoch’s” monument; and other memorials of him are the
engrailed crosses on the east and west gables. These are cut out of the
solid stone, and have probably been renewed.</p>

<p class="nind">examples have been illustrated, and unfortunately, like most others, it
is in a very wasted condition from exposure to the weather. It is also
broken, as shown on the sketch. The slab is of red sandstone, and
measures 5 ft. 8 in. long by 3 ft. 4 in. wide. It is divided into four
sunk panels, with a three-quarter size figure in each panel, and the
figures are flush with the general surface. It cannot be determined what
the costumes of the figures are. No. 2 has, on the dexter side, a
bishop’s crozier, and, on the sinister side, what may have been a
shield. No. 1 was probably distinguished in the same way, there being
something visible on the sinister side. No. 3 has, on dexter side, a
shield with a lion rampant; on sinister side, a square with initials
only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span> the last of which (S) is legible. No. 4 is certainly the figure
of a woman, with large epaulets and a necklace; on her dexter side is a
shield with three innescutcheons, probably for Hay, and, on the sinister
side, the initials B. H. Beneath each pair of figures there has been an
inscription&mdash;the upper one, as far as legible, being, “This is the
honorabille Bv ... Spovs of Arnetvllie.” Of the other marginal
inscriptions nothing legible can be made out. Along the base of the
stone there are sculptured seven small figures.</p>

<p>The dates of the different parts of the cathedral, as given by Abbot
Myln, would, if thoroughly reliable, be invaluable in connection with
the history of Scottish architecture. Few, if any, of our ecclesiastical
edifices have the periods of their erection so distinctly recorded. The
peculiarity of the design, however, renders it somewhat difficult to
make any general application of the above dates to the architecture of
other buildings. It seems likely that the different parts of the
structure were begun at the dates given by Abbot Myln, but not completed
for some time thereafter. From the analogy with other Scottish
structures, especially with Paisley Abbey, which it in some respects
closely resembles, the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral must undoubtedly be
classed as belonging to the third pointed period.</p>

<p>The original settlement of St. Columba in Iona took place <small>A.D.</small> 563.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Dr Skene has shown<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> that the place where the monastery was first
situated lay a short distance to the north of the existing ruins. The
vallum which enclosed the establishment can still be traced, as well as
the burying-ground, the site of the mill, and other features; but the
principal erections, being constructed of wood and wattle, have
necessarily disappeared. Owing to the destruction of the buildings by
fire in 802 and the slaughter of the monks, it was thought desirable, in
818, to rebuild the monastery in stone for greater security, and also to
remove it to the present site, which is better protected by nature. But
the buildings were again destroyed by the Northmen, and seem to have
remained in a ruinous state till 1074, when some attempt to restore the
monastery was made by Queen Margaret.</p>

<p>In 1099 the last of the old order of abbots died, and for more than
fifty years there is an unbroken silence regarding Iona. All the Western
Islands had at this time passed under the rule of the Norwegian King of
the Isles, by whom nothing was done to maintain the religious
establishments, and Iona fell into a state of decay. The rule of the
Norwegian Kings of the Isles having become oppressive, Somerled, King of
Argyll, was applied to for protection, and after a great naval battle,
fought between him and Godred, King of the Isles, in 1156, all the
islands south<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> of Ardnamurchan Point were ceded to Somerled. Amongst
these was Iona, where Reginald, the son of Somerled, undertook the
rebuilding of the monastery on a larger scale. He adopted the policy of
the Scottish kings, and introduced one of the religious orders of the
Roman Church.</p>

<p>“Macvurich tells us that ‘three monasteries were formed by him&mdash;the
monastery of Black Monks in I or Iona, in honour of God and Saint
Columchelle; a monastery of Black Nuns in the same place; and a
monastery of Gray friars in Sagadul, or Saddle, in Kintyre;’ and he
appears to have established the Benedictines or Black Monks in Iona in
the year 1203.”</p>

<p>“The deed of confirmation of the Benedictine Monastery still exists in
the Vatican. It is dated the 9th December 1203, and is addressed to
Celestinus, abbot of Saint Columba, of the island of Hy, and his
brethren professing a religious life; and the pope takes the monastery
of Saint Columba under the protection of Saint Peter and the pope, in
order that the monastic order which has been instituted in that place,
according to the rule of Saint Benedict, may be preserved inviolate in
all time to come; and he confirms to them the place itself in which the
said monastery is situated, with its pertinents, consisting of churches,
islands, and lands in the Western Isles.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Celestine, the abbot of this monastery, appears to have attempted to
thrust out the prior Celtic community; but the latter, with the support
of the clergy of the north of Ireland, resisted and vindicated their
right to remain in the monastery. The Celtic community, however, appear
to have ultimately adopted the Benedictine rule, “while the functionary
formerly known as the Head of the Culdees was represented by the prior
of Iona, whom we afterwards find in the monastery.”</p>

<p>About 1200 the districts to the west of the great range of Drumalban,
which formerly belonged to the diocese of Dunkeld, were separated from
it and formed into a new bishopric, first called of Argyle and
afterwards of Lismore.</p>

<p>During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries Iona was under the Bishop
of Dunkeld, but in 1507 John, Bishop of the Isles, obtained the
annexation of Iona to his see, and the Abbey Church became the cathedral
of the diocese, and so continued till the Reformation.</p>

<p>In 1561 the abbey suffered from the Act anent “demolishing all the
abbeys of monks and friars, and for suppressing whatsoever monuments of
idolatrie were remaining in the realm.” The carrying out of this Act was
remitted to Argyll and Glencairn, and much has been written with regard
to the great damage caused by the mob to the buildings and monuments and
the valuable library.</p>

<p>The island passed into the hands of M‘Lean of Duart, but from 1567
onwards the Protestant bishops of the Isles seem to have had the abbey
in their possession. The buildings, however, appear to have been
neglected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span> and Charles <small>I.</small>, in 1635, directed £400 to be spent in
repairing them. But that does not appear to have been done, and by the
end of the seventeenth century the edifices had fallen into ruin. In
1693 the island came into the hands of the House of Argyll, and within
recent years the ancient buildings have been put in a good state of
preservation by the present Duke.</p>

<p>The edifices which still survive in the island, although ruinous,
exhibit probably the completest and most interesting group of ancient
ecclesiastical structures in Scotland.</p>

<p>There is first the Chapel of St. Oran, a small twelfth century
structure, surrounded by the very ancient churchyard, which contains so
many beautiful specimens of Highland carved tombstones,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> admirably
illustrated by the late James Drummond, R.S.A., in his work on Highland
monuments. Then there are the remains of the Benedictine Monastery, and
those of the Benedictine Nunnery, at a short distance on each side of
St. Oran’s, both of which, though sadly mutilated, still show the
general plan of the church and domestic edifices of these monastic
establishments more completely than any other Scottish examples.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Oran has already been described.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The nunnery is also described among the Norman structures.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The abbey or cathedral, which is now to be described, is classed along
with the buildings of the third pointed period, as the greater part of
the work connected with it belongs to a late date.</p>

<p>When the great distance of the Island of Iona from the centre of
operations of mediæval architecture is considered, it is not unnatural
to find those deviations from the rules and practice of the art which
are so frequent in Scottish architecture even more accentuated here than
is usual. The connection of the locality with the Celtic art of Ireland
and the west of Scotland has also had considerable influence in moulding
the style of the carving and decoration of the Cathedral of the
Isles.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>These facts, although rendering the building somewhat difficult to class
along with the general architecture of the recognised periods of Gothic
in Scotland, yet add much to the interest of this isolated and unique
structure.</p>

<p>It should also be noticed that the cathedral shows signs in all
directions of having been much altered and added to; but as the style of
the masonry of the walls is much the same throughout, whatever its date,
it is somewhat difficult to trace the points of junction of the work of
the various periods. This masonry of all dates consists of large blocks
of red granite of irregular shape, set with flat untooled face to the
outside, and with filling-in of smaller pieces of granite and slaty
stones between the larger blocks.</p>

<p>The monastery (Fig. <a href="#fig_982">982</a>) consists of the church, which contains a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">and a tower over the crossing. The eastern part of the choir (Fig. <a href="#fig_983">983</a>)
forms the presbytery, which, like that of most Scottish churches, is
without aisles, and is lighted by a large central and two side windows,
all containing late tracery. On the south side of the choir, west of the
presbytery, is an aisle, separated from it by two circular piers and
three arches. From above the caps of the piers two bold arches are
thrown across the south aisle, after the manner of flying buttresses
(Fig. <a href="#fig_984">984</a>). It will be observed from this view that there is a
peculiarity of construction in the upper part of the choir walls, the
clerestory windows being placed over the piers and not over the arches,
as is usual. This arrangement has had the effect of preventing the
flying arches or buttresses from being carried as high as they might
have been (Fig. <a href="#fig_985">985</a>) had the windows been placed over the arches in the
ordinary manner. The flying arches or buttresses are thus very low, and
interfere with the space in the aisle (see Plan). There are a sedilia,
with three divisions, and a piscina (Fig. <a href="#fig_986">986</a>) near the east end of the
south wall of the choir. Part of the pavement there still exists, and
two steps are observable in the floor.</p>

<p>On the north side of the choir is the sacristy, which occupies the place
of the north aisle. The door to the sacristy (Fig. <a href="#fig_987">987</a>) is of fine
design, and the ornament of the caps of the shafts (Fig. <a href="#fig_988">988</a>), together
with the caps of the piers between the choir and the south aisle and the
arches of the crossing (Figs. <a href="#fig_989">989</a> and <a href="#fig_990">990</a>), exhibit fine examples of
Celtic carving, mixed with grotesque figures. Carving of an identical
description is shown in Figs. <a href="#fig_991">991</a> and <a href="#fig_992">992</a> on slabs in St. Oran’s Chapel,
one of which, dated 1489, also exhibits late Gothic ornaments on the
edge. This stone bears the following inscription, from which it would
appear to be in memory of the father of Abbot Macfingone, and of the
abbot himself (whose tomb and monument are preserved in the choir, as
will be pointed out further on):&mdash;“Hec: est: Crux: Laeclanni: Meic:
fingone: et: ejus: fil&mdash;Ohannis: Abbatis: de: Hy: facta: Anno: domini:
Mº. <small>CCCCLXXX</small>: <small>IX</small>º. Numerous examples of carving of a very similar
description occur throughout the West Highlands, and, where dated, are
all of about the above period. The undated specimens are also distinctly
in the same style and of the same epoch. There can, therefore, be no
hesitation in assigning the sculpture in the cathedral, which is of a
similar character (such as the caps in Figs. 988 and 990), to about the
same date. The dog-tooth ornaments in Fig. <a href="#fig_993">993</a> and other similar
examples, which are not rare at Iona and throughout the Western Islands,
are thus clearly a revival, at a late date, of ancient forms.</p>

<p>Close to the sacristy door, but raised to a considerable height above
the choir floor, stands a round column (see Fig. <a href="#fig_983">983</a>), which supports
two pointed arches. These arches appear to have opened into an upper
aisle or chapel. They are carved with rows of dog-tooth or nail-head
ornaments, which have the appearance of thirteenth century work; but as
they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">much decayed, they are probably of the late date to which, as we have
seen, many examples of imitation dog-tooth enrichments at Iona and
elsewhere belong.</p>

<p>The parapet of the choir (see Fig. <a href="#fig_984">984</a>) is simple, and is supported on
massive corbels, like those common in the castles of Scotland. The water
of the gutters escapes by small apertures through the parapet.</p>

<p>The nave contains a good western doorway of late design (Fig. <a href="#fig_994">994</a>), with
three orders of mouldings in the jambs, which have no caps, but have the
jamb mouldings carried round the pointed arch. The nave and transepts
have no aisles. The windows of the nave (Fig. <a href="#fig_995">995</a>) are much damaged. At

<p>The whole of the church has been roofed with timber, but is now quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span>
open to the weather. The stone corbels intended to carry the principals
of the roof still remain where the walls are complete (see Fig. <a href="#fig_983">983</a>).</p>

<p>Externally, the most prominent features are the buttresses and base
course (see Figs. <a href="#fig_984">984</a> and <a href="#fig_995">995</a>)). These exist round most of the south wall
of the nave, part of the south transept, and the east end of the choir.
The angle buttresses have the general form, with bead on angle and
sloping table on top, of thirteenth century work, and the broad, sloping
base has also a similar character. Several small intermediate buttresses
are introduced, which are in many cases awkwardly situated as regards
the windows, being kept below the window sills. The base course on the
south side of the nave is set at a level several feet above that of the
south transept (see Fig. <a href="#fig_995">995</a>). It is stopped suddenly before reaching
the eastmost bay of the nave. The base also stops equally suddenly on
the west wall of the south transept, a few feet from the south-west
angle buttress. The base course and buttresses would thus seem, where
they exist, to indicate a rebuilding of those portions of the walls, the
portions left without a base course being possibly older. Although the
forms of the base course and buttresses are of early design, there is no
doubt but that they are late erections, and that the forms and design
are revivals or imitations of older features. Their association with the
late doorway of the nave and the late traceries of the choir and south
transept sufficiently proves their comparatively recent construction.</p>

<p>There will probably be little difference of opinion regarding the
antiquity of the east wall of the north transept (see Fig. <a href="#fig_996">996</a>). The
character of the arches, shafts, and caps, even worn away as they are,
is distinctly late Norman or transition. The small round headed windows
in the recesses of the wide internal bays are also quite in keeping with
that</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 996.</span>&mdash;Iona Cathedral. East Side of North Transept.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">style. The depth of the recesses on each side of the central arch, with
its figure, which form a special feature, was rendered necessary by the
extra width of the wall required (as will be pointed out further on) to
admit of a passage in the thickness of the wall above. Almost all the
rest of the church appears to be of a much later date, and to belong,
with small exceptions, to the late fifteenth or early part of the
sixteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span></p>

<p>Part of the crossing, however, is probably older; but the other portions
of the crossing seem to have been rebuilt at a late date, as the
following indications show. The original arches of the north and west
sides have no mouldings, but are only chamfered, and the caps, so far as
visible, have an ancient character. The north arch has, at some period,
been strengthened by the insertion of additional piers, and an
additional arch within the then existing piers and arch (see Plan). The
old arch is distinctly visible in the wall, and portions of the old
piers are also exposed to view.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_997" style="width: 534px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 997.</span>&mdash;Iona Cathedral. North Side of Refectory.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The arches of the east and south sides of the crossing are of a
different character from the above, the arches being fully moulded. The
piers (Fig. <a href="#fig_998">998</a>) do not differ much from those of the older sides, and
are all of an early form of design. The same character is kept up in the
inserted piers of the north arch, although these must undoubtedly be
later than the original piers. The mouldings seem all to have been
imitated from early forms (such as we find in the choir arch of the
nunnery).<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The changes in the plans of the piers and mouldings,
common in the central districts of the mainland, would be long in
reaching this distant spot, and the old forms appear to have been,
therefore, adhered to. Such continuations or imitations of early forms
are very common in Scotland. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span> should be observed that the outer or
central shaft of each pier has a fillet on its central line, which
indicates (especially here) a somewhat advanced date (see Fig. <a href="#fig_996">996</a>). The
bases are of a very late type, as also the caps, both of which differ
from those of the earlier piers. From these facts we infer that the
south and east sides of the crossing have been rebuilt at a late period,
possibly at the time when the tower was erected. That part of the
edifice is always justly regarded as being very late, and the
rectangular windows and their tracery clearly support that view. If the
above supposition is correct, then the insertion of the additional piers
and arch under the north tower arch is explained. That addition would be
made at the time the tower was built, in order to make sure that the
support was sufficient to carry it. Similar extra strengthening was not
necessary in the case of the west arch, as it already had sufficient
piers and supports; and the additions to the piers of the north arch,
which</p>

<p>South-East Pier of Crossing.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">previously were small, simply made them of similar strength to those of
the west arch.</p>

<p>We therefore conclude that the original north and west arches and piers
of the crossing are old, perhaps of the thirteenth century; while the
east and south arches and piers have been rebuilt, and the additional
piers and arch added to the north opening, probably when the tower was
erected.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the choir. When we consider the forms of the tracery
of the three windows of the presbytery (see Figs. <a href="#fig_983">983</a> and <a href="#fig_984">984</a>), and the
north window in Fig. <a href="#fig_999">999</a>), the thickness of the mullions, and the number
and smallness of their mouldings, there cannot be much difficulty in
assigning these windows to a late date. The forms and decorations of the
arches of the sedilia (see Fig. <a href="#fig_986">986</a>) also clearly indicate a late
period. These are exceedingly good of their kind, and it is a misfortune
that the Celtic ornament with which they are covered is now so far
decayed as to be scarcely legible; but there can be no question as to
the lateness of their date.</p>

<p>On turning to the south aisle the same impression is received. The
circular and stunted form of the piers, with their remarkable bases and
the peculiar form of their enriched capitals (see Figs. <a href="#fig_989">989</a> and <a href="#fig_990">990</a>)),
strike one at once with the idea that they belong to a late and rather
debased epoch. The insertion of the clerestory windows over the piers
(an arrangement which is also met with at the nunnery) is bad
construction, and led<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span> to the adoption of the low and poor flying
buttresses (which are evidently an afterthought) as a means of steadying
the main structure.</p>

<p>Section of Arch Mouldings.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">arches of the high chapel over the sacristy (see Fig. <a href="#fig_983">983</a>) are of
thirteenth century work, as their ornamentation would at first sight
lead one to suppose, they might possibly have been re-erected in their
present position; but they are more likely to have been made in
imitation of thirteenth century work, and built here at a late period.
The section of the arch mouldings (Fig. <a href="#fig_1000">1000</a>) is almost identical with
that of the chapter house arches, which (as will be afterwards
explained) are almost undoubtedly of very late date.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span></p>

<p>These arches gave a view of the altar from a high chapel, which, as will
be pointed out, was perhaps connected with the library or dormitory. The
chapel has been added to the church, and the walls are not bonded into
the choir. The decoration of the upper portion, with its imitation
dog-tooth or nail-head ornament round a straight sided arch (Fig. <a href="#fig_1001">1001</a>),
shows that it is of very late date.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1001" style="width: 351px;">

<img src="images/ill_pg_068.jpg" width="351" height="475" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1001.</span>&mdash;Iona Cathedral. Interior of Sacristy and
Chapel above.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This structure appears to occupy the position of the original north
aisle, which at one time extended (or was contemplated) the full length
from the presbytery to the north transept. The water table over the old
aisle roof runs the whole length, and has a sloping water table where
the roof abutted against the north transept. The old corbels to receive
the timbers of the aisle roof also still exist. The aisle would no doubt
block one of the Norman transept windows, but that could not be
avoided.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span></p>

<p>The doorway from the choir to the sacristy (see Fig. <a href="#fig_987">987</a>) is a very fine
feature, and one would be inclined to consider it somewhat earlier than
the other parts of the sacristy and upper chapel. Possibly it may have
formed an access to the aisle before the upper chapel was raised to its
present position.</p>

<p>The above examination of the choir, south aisle, and sacristy leads to
the belief that they are all of a late period, probably about 1500. The
entire building bears evidence of having been in whole or part
re-erected about the end of the fifteenth century or the beginning of
the sixteenth century, possibly when it became the Cathedral of the
Isles in 1506. Some portions, such as the north transept, the north and
west sides of the crossing, the wheel stair to the tower and parts of
the walling connected therewith, are older; but all the rest, including
the east and south arches of the crossing, is of a much later date.
Besides the points to which attention has been drawn above, it may be
noted that the buttresses of the choir, which from their form may have
been raised from ancient bases, have on each angle a single bead on
their lower part and a triple bead on the upper part (see Fig. <a href="#fig_984">984</a>). The
upper story of the tower, which is admittedly very late, has also a
triple bead on the angles of the top story. May it not have happened
that the building suffered from some cause, or was intentionally taken
down and reconstructed about the end of the fifteenth or beginning of
the sixteenth century? Such an event might account for the antique form
of the buttresses, which may have been raised from existing portions of
old buttresses; while the triple bead on their upper story would show
the change of style introduced at the time of the reconstruction. It
would also explain the preservation of the old doorway to the sacristy,
while the upper parts of the walls were rebuilt. The very irregular
appearance of the lower part of the north wall of the choir might also
be thus accounted for. The interior string course on the north side,
which rises in large steps from the sacristy door, is composed of stones
partly enriched and partly plain, as if it formed part of a
reconstruction in which old materials had been reused. The clerestory
windows, with their ancient forms, are doubtless reproductions of the
outlines which formerly existed.</p>

<p>The section of the south-east pier of the crossing (see Fig. <a href="#fig_998">998</a>) shows
that the south transept is of about the same period as the choir, the
round responds in each corresponding with the circular piers of the
choir, and the carved caps being very similar in both (see Figs. <a href="#fig_989">989</a> and
<a href="#fig_990">990</a>)); and the south wall of the transept, with its late traceried window
and buttresses and base course, is evidently of the same period as the
presbytery. The mouldings of the mullions are in both cases returned
along the sills, an unusual and late arrangement.</p>

<p>The rebuilt part of the crossing has arch moulds which correspond in
style with those of the south aisle arches, and the sculpture of the
caps<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1002" style="width: 692px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">also corresponds with that of the aisle piers, both containing, as above
mentioned, fine examples of Celtic foliage and figures. The peculiar
traceried windows at the east end of the south aisle of choir and the
adjoining piscina (see Fig. <a href="#fig_999">999</a>) are also clearly of late date.</p>

<p>The cloister lies to the north of the nave; it measures 73 feet from
north to south by 66 feet from east to west. The cloister walk has had a
wooden roof all round, resting on corbels (see Fig. <a href="#fig_994">994</a>) in the main
wall, and on an arcade on the side next the cloister garth. Some
fragments of the shafts and arches of the arcade are preserved in the
chapter house, and the bases of a twin column, socketed for the shafts,
stand on the wall at the north-west angle. The arcade would thus appear
to have rested on coupled shafts, and, so far as can be ascertained by
examination of the only surviving portion at the south-west angle and
the fragments in the chapter house, the arches were pointed and carved
with Celtic ornament somewhat similarly to the arches of the sedilia in
the choir (see Fig. <a href="#fig_986">986</a>). In each angle of the cloister walk an arch has
been thrown across the walk diagonally, so as to strengthen and steady
the walls. Only one of these arches, that at the south-west angle (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_994">994</a>), remains entire, those in the other angles being reduced to
fragments. This arch is the only one which is moulded on the edge, the
others being splayed. These arches have evidently been built after the
walls adjoining, as they fit awkwardly against previously existing
doorways at the north-east and north-west angles. That at the south-west
angle butts against a structure which seems to have formed a turret
adjoining the north-west angle of the nave. This turret contains a small
chamber, at about 7 feet to 8 feet above the floor of the nave, which
enters by a small door from the nave, and is said to be the porter’s
lodge. It has a curiously cusped loophole opening in the direction of
the church door.</p>

<p>The cloister is surrounded by buildings on the east and north. The north
transept has a door to the cloister, and a benitier is placed near the
entrance. Next to the transept on the north is a chamber, 10 feet wide,
entering from the cloister (see Fig. <a href="#fig_982">982</a>), and lighted by a window to
the east. There is a fireplace in the east wall of this room, being the
only fireplace in the monastery. It seems doubtful whether this chamber
was not originally the slype or passage from the cloister towards the
east, as there is no other passage.</p>

<p>Next to this, on the north, is the chapter house, which projects beyond
the general line of the buildings, the portion next the cloister having
the appearance of a vestibule. The inner cloister enters from the
vestibule by two arches (Fig. <a href="#fig_1002">1002</a>), which rest on a central round
pillar and corbels at the sides. This pillar is sometimes stated to be
of Norman work, and the chapter house is, consequently, regarded as of
Norman date. But a careful examination of the pillar and its capital
leads to the conclusion that it is comparatively a late structure. The
carving of the cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span> (Fig. <a href="#fig_1003">1003</a>) is very peculiar. On the outer or west
side, the ornament, which is somewhat decayed, resembles that of the
caps of the adjoining nunnery church, and may easily be mistaken for
ancient. But the ornament of the inner or east side of the cap (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1003">1003</a>) is quite different, and is undoubtedly of very late design, being
similar to that on the carved tombstones of the fifteenth or sixteenth
centuries, such as that in Figs. 991 and 992. The dog-tooth or nail-head
ornament of the arches, although at first sight like first pointed work,
is found, on closer inspection, to consist of late imitations&mdash;showing
three small nail-heads placed close together, so as to form an
enrichment in a manner not at all transition like. The same remark
applies to the enrichments of the high chapel in the choir (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1000">1000</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1003" style="width: 462px;">

</div>

<p>The walls of the eastern part of the cloister are not over 2 feet 6
inches in thickness (which would be very unusual in Norman work), and
they have been strengthened by interior piers when the present flat
barrel arch was erected over the chapter house. This probably took place
when the upper part of this portion of the building was raised a story
in height, possibly in order to form the library on the upper floor. It
is evident, from an examination of the junction of the walls on the
exterior, that the upper floor of this part of the building was added at
a late period. Both vestibule and chapter house appear to have had a
stone seat running along the walls, and the whole may possibly have
formed the place of assembly of the monks. Probably, like the chapter
house at St. Andrews, the western portion, or vestibule, was the
original chapter house, and the inner division was added at a later
period.</p>

<p>From the chapter house a passage is visible in the upper part of the
east wall of the north transept. In order to admit of this, the wall of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> transept (as above pointed out) has required to be made of great
thickness, and this explains the depth of the two recesses under it in
the transept previously referred to. As already mentioned, there was an
upper floor over the chapter house and the adjoining portions of the
east range of the cloister buildings. Part of this upper floor is
believed to have been the library&mdash;the literary treasures of which were
famous&mdash;and part would, no doubt, be the dormitory of the monks.</p>

<p>It seems not improbable that the passage in the transept wall may have
led from the library or dormitory to the chapel in the upper aisle of
the choir over the sacristy, and the use of that chapel would thus be
explained. The chapel, as already mentioned, is a structure of late
erection, as is apparent from the imitation dog-tooth running round the
straight-sided arch of the east window (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1002">1002</a>). The passage in
the transept wall may be much older, but was possibly utilised in
connection with the late reconstruction of the monastery, as above
suggested.</p>

<p>To the north of the chapter house are two chambers of good size, over
which an upper story has extended, as the remains of the windows show.</p>

<p>The north side of the cloister has been occupied by the refectory, a
building 63 feet long by 20 feet wide. It is situated on the first or
upper floor, and is of late work; but seems to occupy the position of a
previous refectory, which formerly stood on the site, and of which some
portions of the walls remain. The first refectory appears to have been
on the ground floor, as the remains of what must have been a handsome
doorway in the south wall near the west end of this range prove. This
doorway has had three orders of mouldings with shafts and caps, about 7
feet high, apparently of thirteenth century work, of which some
fragments remain, partly built into the adjoining angle structure. The
latter is evidently a late erection, as it encloses part of the west
jamb of the above doorway. The pier of the diagonal arch of the cloister
walk at the east end of the refectory also encroaches on the door beside
it. At a somewhat late period the refectory has been raised to the upper
floor, and an entrance made to it by a wide staircase at the east end
(which would also probably form the day staircase to the dormitory). The
ground floor is low, and has loopholes for windows. It has apparently
been used for cellars or storages. There is a wide pointed doorway
leading into it at the north-west angle (see Fig. <a href="#fig_997">997</a>). The north
elevation of the structure is fairly preserved.</p>

<p>The buttresses seem to be reconstructions on the lines of the original
ones, but the windows, both in the north elevation and towards the
cloister, are of later date.</p>

<p>The eastern range of buildings is continued northwards beyond the
refectory by a chamber 33 feet long by 12 feet 6 inches wide, which
seems to have been connected on the upper floor with a lavatory and
latrine. The latter has a built channel, evidently intended, from the
low aperture at each end, for the passage of a stream of water, which
could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span> easily led into it from the neighbouring burn. To the west of
this stand the walls, 3 feet high, of a nearly detached edifice, with a
separate outer doorway, which may perhaps have been an infirmary. To the
north-east, the low walls are observable of a detached structure 58 feet
9 inches long by 21 feet 6 inches wide. The only wall opening traceable
is the doorway, which has been of simple design. This is supposed by
some to have been the kitchen, but it seems doubtful. There is no
appearance of a fireplace.</p>

<p>A small detached chapel, 38 feet in length by 20 feet 9 inches in width
over the walls, lies to the north-east of the chapter house. It has had
a doorway in the north wall, a small centre window in the east wall, and
a similar window in each of the side walls near the east end. The
windows are trefoil headed and cusped, and appear to be late. The
doorway had two orders, with a bead on each. The orientation of this
building is different from that of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Adjoining the south-west angle of the cloister, and built out from it,
is a small enclosure containing stone coffins (see Fig. <a href="#fig_994">994</a>).
Immediately beyond this are the remains of another enclosure, connected
with a Celtic cross (called St. Martin’s) near the west end of the
cathedral (see Fig. <a href="#fig_995">995</a>). The inner of these chambers, which encloses
the stone coffins, is called “St. Columba’s Tomb.” Dr. Skene is of
opinion that it is actually the structure which contained the body of
St. Columba, the coffin of that Saint being placed on the right or south
side, and that of St. Blathmac (a martyr who died in defending the abbey
against the Northmen in 825) being placed on the left or north side.
This view is, however, controverted by Sir Henry Dryden in a MS. of
1879, deposited in the Antiquarian Museum in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>There is also a well in the same locality as the above enclosures.</p>

<p>The ruins of a chapel of some size (48 feet long by 30 feet wide over
the walls) lie at a short distance to the west of the cloister. The
walls are reduced to a few feet in height, and are partly rebuilt in a
rough manner. There seems to have been a doorway in the east end, but
this is doubtless not original. A turret can be traced at the south-east
angle and another at the south-west angle.</p>

<p>To the north-east of the cloister lie the total ruins of what is called
the Abbot’s House, and at some distance to the south-east of the church
may be observed the greatly demolished remains of a chapel.</p>

<p>In the choir are preserved several monuments. On the south side, close
to the sedilia (see Fig. <a href="#fig_986">986</a>), lies the well sculptured effigy of Abbot
Kenneth; and on the north side, near the door of the sacristy, is the
effigy of Abbot M‘Kinnon, the last abbot of Iona (the head being visible
in Fig. <a href="#fig_987">987</a>), around which is legible the following inscription, “Hic
jacet Johannes MacFingone, Abbas de Hy qui obiit anno Domini Millessimo
Quingentessimo cujus animae propitietur Deus Altissimus. Amen.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span></p>

<p>In the floor of the choir a large slab shows the remains of brass work,
and against the east wall rests the carved figure of a knight, with
shield and spear, said to be the monument of a M‘Lean (see Fig. <a href="#fig_983">983</a>).</p>

<h2><a name="ST_MACHARS_CATHEDRAL_Old_Aberdeen" id="ST_MACHARS_CATHEDRAL_Old_Aberdeen"></a>ST. MACHAR’S CATHEDRAL, <span class="smcap">Old Aberdeen</span>.</h2>

<p>Old Aberdeen is situated on the river Don, about two miles north from
the town of Aberdeen on the Dee. The cathedral, which is dedicated to
St. Machar, is built in granite, and is now considerably reduced in size
from its original dimensions. The nave (Fig. <a href="#fig_1004">1004</a>) is entire and is used
as the parish church. The walls of the transepts exist only to the
height of about 10 feet. The choir has been entirely destroyed. The
bishop’s palace, which stood at the east end of the cathedral, has also
disappeared. It was a large building, and “had a fine court, having a
high tower at each of its four corners; an outer and inner gate; with a
deep well in the middle of the court; and an iron gate by which the
bishop passed from his palace into the choir.”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>The cathedral stands on the north side of an extensive churchyard, and
the situation is pleasant, having the houses of the chanonry&mdash;some of
them quaint-looking and interesting&mdash;approaching it on the south. On the
north it is skirted by high trees, which grow on a steep bank sloping
down from the cathedral towards the Don.</p>

<p>The seat of the bishop was translated from Murthlack or Mortlack, in
Banffshire, to Aberdeen by King David <small>I.</small> in the year 1136, St. Nectan
being the last bishop of Mortlack and the first of Aberdeen. The third
bishop, Matthew Kinninmond, began to build a cathedral between 1183 and
1199 to supersede the primitive church then existing, “which [new
building], because it was not glorious enough, Bishop Cheyne threw
down.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>A second edifice was begun by Bishop Cheyne shortly after 1282, and the
work went on till the time when the country was involved in the war with
Edward <small>I.</small> After Bruce was seated on the throne, Cheyne was temporarily
banished, and “during his absence the king, seeing the new cathedral he
had begun, made the church to be built with the revenues of the
bishoprick.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The cathedral thus erected was in its turn thrown down by Bishop
Alexander Kinninmond, who succeeded in 1355, and he began a new building
on a still larger scale about the year 1370. Of his operations there
remain two large piers for the support of the central tower, which form
the earliest portion of the structure of St. Machar’s now remaining.
These piers are built of red freestone, and are much more graceful an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span>d</p>

<p class="nind">refined in character than the succeeding work, most of which is
constructed in granite. Bishop Kinninmond may possibly have built the
bay of the nave adjoining for a buttress to the central tower. Freestone
mouldings similar to those of the tower still remain at the springing,
as if they had continued across to the first pillar; but the arch must
have been taken down, as the existing bays are all of granite, and the
granite mouldings&mdash;which are of quite a different section&mdash;are seen to
butt against those of Kinninmond’s time.</p>

<p>The nave may be said to be all of one period, and appears to have been
principally built, including the two western towers, by Bishop Henry
Leighton between 1422 and 1440. It was roofed in by his successor,
Bishop Lindsay, and in the <i>View of the Diocese</i> it is said to have been
leaded over by the Bishops Elphinston and Dunbar, and “ceiled by this
last,” <small>A.D.</small> 1518-1531. The flat ceiling of oak erected by Bishop Dunbar
still remains (Fig. <a href="#fig_1005">1005</a>), having been constructed by him at his own
“pains and expenses.” “James Winter, an Angus man, was architect of the
timber work and ceiling of said church; which was well done, and may
make his name famous to after ages.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> It is ornamented with heraldic
decorations, containing the arms of various European kings, Pope Leo <small>X.</small>,
the Scottish nobility, and Churchmen. These have been drawn and
illustrated in colour by the New Spalding Club. Bishop Dunbar also
finished Leighton’s towers by adding the spires (Fig. <a href="#fig_1006">1006</a>) in grey
freestone. The general colour of the granite work is of a reddish yellow
tint.</p>

<p>The edifice as it now stands measures on the outside as follows,
viz.&mdash;length of nave about 143 feet, width 77 feet. The transept is
about 121 feet long by 37 feet 6 inches wide. The centre alley of the
nave is 30 feet 6 inches wide. The towers are about 23 feet 6 inches
square, and about 111 feet high.</p>

<p>The west front of St. Machar’s (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1006">1006</a>) is entirely built with
granite, except the spires, and is one of the most impressive and
imposing structures in Scotland. It is extremely plain, not a single
scrap of carving being visible anywhere, and most of the openings are of
the simplest kind. This front is a veritable piece of Doric work,
depending for its effect on its just proportion and the mass of its
granite masonry. The towers and spires are of equal height, and almost
identical in design. The great corbels and machicolations of the parapet
are clearly derived from castellated forms, and the embrasured bands
round the spires and their numerous lucarnes are distinct signs of the
late date of their construction. The entrance doorway (Fig. <a href="#fig_1007">1007</a>) is
remarkable, the jambs being mere rounds and hollows, with a flat stone
laid along at the springing of the round arch, marking where the
capitals usually stand, while the arch mouldings are of the most
elementary kind, all being designed to suit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span> hard granite of which
they are constructed. Above this doorway is one of the most striking
features of the composition, viz.&mdash;the seven lofty narrow windows (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_1006">1006</a>), about 26 feet in height, and each crowned</p>

keeping spades and shovels in.</p>

</div>

<p>The south elevation (Fig. <a href="#fig_1008">1008</a>) is marked by the same simplicity as the
west front, being designed to suit the intractable material of which it
is built. The clerestory is an absolutely plain wall, pierced by narrow
round arched windows, without a moulding of any kind, while the windows
of the side aisles are filled with the simplest tracery. The effect of
this part of the building is much marred by the removal of the parapet
which formerly ran along the top of the wall. The south porch is a
dignified structure. It was evidently meant to have a room over the
entrance, for which a window is provided; but there is no indication<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span> of
there ever having been an upper floor or an access stair, and the
considerable height, as viewed from the inside, has an unmeaning
appearance. The resemblance between this porch and the south porch of
St. Michael’s, Linlithgow, is striking, both having the inner
crow-stepped gable built on the aisle wall. In the latter porch the
upper room has been completed.</p>

<p>Top of West Windows.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The north aisle wall of the cathedral, which is fortunately not so well
seen as the south wall, is quite modern, and has a mean and paltry
appearance.</p>

<p>The pillars in the nave (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1005">1005</a>) are all round on Plan, with
round moulded caps and very simple bases. These are shown in section in
Fig. <a href="#fig_1005">1005</a>, and also on a larger scale in Fig. <a href="#fig_1010">1010</a>, which contains
Scougal’s monument (afterwards referred to), and where there is also a
view of part of the interior of the large west window. Beside the sketch
of this monument will be seen a stone containing the arms, surmounted by
a mitre, probably of Bishop Stewart, who died in 1565 (a fesse chequé
debruised by a bend engrailed).</p>

<p>In the view of the interior (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1005">1005</a>) it may be observed that the
full thickness of the clerestory walls does not come down to the caps of
the pillars, but stops short a few feet above. This arrangement has an
unpleasing effect in perspective, leaving a portion of the cap
projecting and bearing nothing. The two piers at the crossing, as
already mentioned, are of freestone and are of clustered form, and have
richly carved capitals. These capitals are necessarily concealed by the
building up of the arches, which lead from the nave to the crossing.
Fig. <a href="#fig_1011">1011</a> shows a part of one of these capitals, which can be seen from
the transept.</p>

<p>Regarding the choir nothing can be now said from observation, as it was
destroyed in 1560, and the ruins have since been entirely removed.
Alluding to this, Orme says (p. 104)&mdash;“The glorious structure of said
Cathedral Church being near nine score years in building, did not remain
twenty entire, when it was almost ruined by a crew of sacrilegious
church robbers.”</p>

<p>There was an old choir standing in Bishop Elphinston’s time, early in
the sixteenth century, which, as Boece tells us in his life of that
prelate,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> was considered by the bishop to be in a style unworthy such
a church, and he began to rebuild it on a plan corresponding with the
western part of the building; “but lest he should die before it was
completed, he would not take down the old choir till everything was in
readiness to begin the new one, so that a considerable part was finished
before his death.” The work was continued by his successors, but it
seems doubtful if it ever was entirely completed before the Reformation
burst on the country.</p>

<p>The building of the central steeple, which had been partly carried out<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span>
by Bishop Leighton, was finally completed by Bishop Elphinston about
1511. The tower was supported by the four pillars of the crossing. “It</p>

<p class="nind">was four storey high, and square, and had two battlements, and seems to
have been about 150 foot high.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span></p>

<p>Bishop Leighton also built, in 1424, the north transept, or, as it was
called, St. John’s Aisle, where the beautiful sculpture of that bishop’s
effigy now lies inglorious beneath a rough brick arch (Fig. <a href="#fig_1012">1012</a>). His
tomb appears to have been entire when Orme (who died about 1725) wrote
his description of the cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> He describes it as an effigy <i>in
pontificalibus</i>, on an altar tomb with a canopy, under which is this
inscription: “<i>Hic jacet bone memorie Henricus de Lichtoun</i>,” &amp;c.
Huddled in behind the figure there is a large stone slab with an
inscription, which can hardly be seen on account of the rubbish and ivy.</p>

<p>The south transept was built by Bishop Dunbar in 1522. And so recently
as the time of Orme large portions of it, which have now disappeared,</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1011" style="width: 306px;">

</div>

<p class="nind">were standing, if, indeed, it was not almost entire at that date. Orme
speaks of the “top of this aisle” as having then been taken down for the
miserable purpose of furnishing stones for new buildings at the college;
and he also mentions large windows as then existing, all of which have
vanished. Indeed, almost nothing of this transept now remains except the
tomb of the founder, Bishop Gavin Dunbar (Fig. <a href="#fig_1013">1013</a>), and an empty tomb
to the left of it, which were complete when Orme wrote. The latter
contained the effigy of a bishop, “a lion at his feet, and under his
head a pointed helmet for a cushion; arms, a lion rampant <i>queue
fourche</i> debruised by a bend charged with three escallops.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span> probably a tomb of the end of the sixteenth century. The foliage
round the arch, modelled from seaweed, is carved with great spirit.
Dunbar’s tomb is perhaps the finest of the minor pieces of work now
remaining here. It is remarkable how it escaped destruction on various
occasions, and especially in 1693, when a gang of religious fanatics
broke his effigy in pieces, defaced the inscription, smashed the hanging
cusped tracery round</p>

monument. The existing cornice, with its two rows of corbels, was
erected afterwards; and it must be allowed that it harmonises well with
the earlier work, although it has more of the spirit of domestic than of
ecclesiastical architecture. A similar kind of battlement is introduced
over the centre panel of the Amond Monument, at Ellon, in the same
county <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span></p>

In the spandrils of the arch of the bishop’s tomb are the royal arms of
Scotland and those of Dunbar (three cushions pendant at the corners in a
bordure). The label terminals near the head and feet of the effigy are
designed as angels bearing shields. Orme states that, in 1640, under the
direction of the Earl of Seaforth and others, “A mason struck out</p>

building.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Both of the above tombs are of freestone.</p>

<p>A very interesting monument, also in freestone, is built into the south
wall of the nave (Fig. <a href="#fig_1015">1015</a>). It is in bas relief, the depth of the
recess above the effigy being only two inches from the projection of the
arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> moulding, yet within this slight recess the sculptor has obtained
a wonderful effect in the beautiful figure, supposed to represent
Archdeacon Barbour, the poet, who died in 1396. If this is Barbour’s
monument, it must have been erected a considerable time after his death,
as the nave was not built till after that event. There is a long
inscription beneath the monument, which, so far as we know, has never
been decyphered. The length of the recess in which the figure lies is 3
feet 11½ inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1015" style="width: 543px;">

</div>

<p>The whole breadth of the monument is 4 feet 4 inches, and the height,
including the inscription and base course (exclusive of the lower
inscription), to the top of the horizontal cornice is 2 feet 6 inches.
It stands at a height of 6 feet 6 inches from the floor to the bed of
the figure.</p>

<p>At the west end of the south aisle is the monument (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1010">1010</a>) of
Bishop Patrick Scougal, who, as his epitaph says, “enriched the
Cathedral of St. Machar,” and other places in Aberdeen, “with
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span>siderable tokens of his great bounty.” The monument was erected in
1685, the year of his death.</p>

<h2><a name="TRINITY_COLLEGE_CHURCH_Edinburgh" id="TRINITY_COLLEGE_CHURCH_Edinburgh"></a>TRINITY COLLEGE CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>.</h2>

<p>This church stood in the hollow between the Old and New Towns of
Edinburgh, on the west side of Leith Wynd. It was founded by Mary of
Gueldres, Queen of James <small>II.</small>, shortly after that king’s death in 1460,
the charter of erection being dated 1462. The edifice was dedicated to
the “honour and praise of the Holy Trinity, to the ever blessed and
glorious Virgin Mary, to Saint Ninian the Confessor, and to all the
saints and elect people of God.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The foundation was established for a provost, eight prebendaries, and
two clerks, and in 1502 there were added a dean and sub-dean. Lands and
benefices sufficient were bestowed on the establishment for its
maintenance.</p>

<p>Connected with the college was “Trinity Hospital,” also founded by Queen
Mary of Gueldres. After the Reformation the endowments passed into the
hands of the Town Council, who maintained the Hospital as a city charity
for decayed burgesses and their families.</p>

<p>The church became the place of worship of a new parochial division
called “Trinity College Parish,” and so continued till 1848, when it was
removed to make way for the station of the North British Railway
Company.</p>

<p>Trinity College Church was a very fine specimen of the Scottish Gothic
architecture of the fifteenth century. It showed (as has been pointed
out in the Introduction) that much of the middle pointed or decorated
style continued to be used in this country long after it had been given
up in England. This view is supported by Richman, who says of this
church: “The interior is a very beautiful decorated composition, with
the capitals of the piers enriched with foliage, not exceeded in design
or execution in any English cathedral”; and he also adds, “This building
is all of good decorated character, and deserving of minute examination
and study.” During the erection of the church “the master of works” was
John Halkerston, who, in recent books, is frequently referred to as the
architect; but, as has been pointed out elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> he seems to have
acted as paymaster, not as designer.</p>

<p>The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1016">1016</a>)<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> consisted of a choir, with north and south
aisles, and a five-sided eastern apse, north and south transepts, with
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> commencement of a tower over the crossing, and a north sacristy.
The nave was never erected, the arch leading to the west from the
transept being built up, and having a circular window inserted therein.
It is supposed that the progress of the structure was arrested by the
death of the foundress, which occurred in 1463. The choir, including the
apse, was 69 feet in length by 25 feet in width internally. The north
and south aisles extended along the three bays of the choir, the north
aisle</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1016" style="width: 530px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1016.</span>&mdash;Trinity College Church. Plan.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">being 13 feet wide and the south aisle 9 feet wide. The apse was the
full width and height of the central choir, and had a lofty window in
each of its three central divisions. The transepts had small
projections; the whole internal length of the transept, including the
crossing, being 74 feet and the width 24 feet.</p>

<p>The choir and aisles were roofed with fine groined vaulting. That of the
side aisles was simple, but the vault of the choir was ornamented with
ridge ribs and several intermediate ribs, or tiercerons, springing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span>
vaulting shafts, supported on corbels and provided with carved caps, and
all the vaults were studded with carved bosses. The effect of the
vaulting of the apse was specially beautiful. Each bay of the choir had
clustered piers (Fig. <a href="#fig_1017">1017</a>), with finely carved capitals. Above these
was a string course, then a piece of plain wall in the space usually
occupied by the triforium, and the whole was crowned with the traceried

<p>Owing to the removal of the building, it has been impossible to make
original illustrations for this work, but we are fortunate in being able
to publish copies of a series of sketches made by the late James
Drummond, R.S.A., in 1845. These picturesque sketches give a good idea
of the nature of the structure, both internally and externally. Fig.
<a href="#fig_1018">1018</a> is a view of the exterior of the south side of the choir, showing
the three bays into which the aisle was divided by buttresses, from
which flying arches extended to the upper part of the choir. The
buttresses had simple set-offs, and were crowned with pinnacles, which,
for the most part, seem to have been greatly decayed. In the depth of
the buttresses next the south transept a porch was formed, which was
roofed with fine groined vaulting. This porch is also well shown in Fig.
<a href="#fig_1018">1018</a>. The arch is moulded, and dies against the buttresses, and is
crowned with a reversed curve and a flowered finial. There were
carefully carved canopies and corbels for statues on the face of the
buttresses on each side of the porch, and the other buttresses seem to
have had similar niches. A round-headed doorway in the porch gave access
to the choir, and had a square-headed window over it.</p>

<p>The aisle windows had double splayed jambs and arches (Fig. <a href="#fig_1019">1019</a>) both
in the exterior and interior of the wall openings, but the original
tracery had been broken, and its place was supplied with one upright
mullion in the centre and a transome (Fig. <a href="#fig_1020">1020</a>). This sketch also shows
the south end of the south transept, which preserved its four mullions,
of varied thickness, and its tracery. The latter is of a kind not
uncommon in late Scottish churches.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_1021">1021</a> shows the exterior of the north transept, and the north side
of the choir and the sacristy. The north end wall of the transept

<p class="nind">a moulded window in which the original tracery was preserved. This
showed a central mullion with quatrefoil in the arch-head, and the
smaller arches foiled or cusped. The buttress at the sacristy was well
preserved. The pinnacle was apparently original and of good design. On
the front of the buttress a small additional pinnacle was introduced,
which would give considerable character to the design. Fig. <a href="#fig_1018">1018</a> shows
that the same arrangement was evidently adopted in the corresponding
buttress on the south side. The arches of the flying buttresses are also
visible in the sketches of both sides of the church. The roof of the
north aisle seems to have been covered with stone slabs.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>A building 17 feet in length by 16 feet in width internally projected
from the north wall. It is sometimes called the chapter house, but was
more likely the sacristy. It had a round-headed doorway opening into the
north aisle (Fig. <a href="#fig_1022">1022</a>), a good window to the east, and a smaller
square-headed window to the west. There are two ambries in the west and
north walls, a fireplace in the north wall, and a squint window in the
south-east angle commanding a view of the high altar. At the north-east
angle there was a buttress with a pinnacle, and at the north-west angle
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_1021">1021</a>) an octagonal projection, which, doubtless, contained a
wheel stair to an upper floor, the window of which is seen in the
sketch. The roof was covered with stone slabs, and a chimney with
battlement ornament crowned the north gable. The fireplace of the
sacristy is said to have comprised a fine specimen of a Gothic chimney.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_1023">1023</a> shows the interior of the south transept. The transept had no
aisles or chapels. The main arches of the crossing spring from clustered
responds against the walls with carved caps, and the groined vaulting of
the transept&mdash;which was similar to that of the choir&mdash;with its numerous
moulded ribs enriched with bosses, is seen springing from wall shafts
and corbels. The south window, with its mullions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span></p>

and its corbel course, and an example of one of the gargoyles carved in
the form of an animal. The monkey was a favourite subject of the carvers
in this church, and it as well as other figures were used in great
profusion. The cape house and angle pinnacle are also again visible.</p>

the remains of the royal foundress; and a skeleton, in an

<p>The ancient City of Perth, one of the favourite residences of the kings
of Scotland, formerly possessed, as might be expected, many well endowed
religious establishments. The principal of these was the Dominican or
Blackfriars’ Monastery, founded by Alexander <small>II.</small> in 1231. The buildings
were extensive, and formed the residence of the Scottish kings when in
the Fair City. It was here that James <small>I.</small> was staying at the time of his
assassination. The Carmelites or Whitefriars had also a convent close to
Perth, founded in the reign of Alexander <small>III.</small> The Charter House or
Carthusian Monastery in Perth was the only house of that order in
Scotland. It was founded by James <small>I.</small> and his queen in 1429. The
Franciscans’ or Greyfriars’ Monastery was founded by Lord Oliphant in
1460. There were also numerous nunneries and chapels, some of very
ancient date; but all these religious establishments have now entirely
disappeared, the only ancient ecclesiastical structure still remaining
(and it has been greatly changed) being the Parish Church of St. John
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span> Baptist, from which the city derived the title of “St. John’s
Town.” This edifice still serves its original purpose of the parish
church of the town, but it has in modern times been divided by walls so
as to form three places of worship.</p>

<p>So far as we have been able to discover, no complete history of this
church has ever been written, and the circumstances connected with its
original erection and subsequent reconstruction do not appear to have
been definitely ascertained and described. It is certain that a church
existed here in the twelfth century, and it is obvious, from an
inspection of the structure, that not a single stone of that early
building remains to enable its size and appearance to be determined. All
knowledge in regard to the existing fabric must, therefore, be derived
from the internal evidence of the building itself, with such slight aid
as can be got from written records. The following are some scattered
notices of St. John’s Church gathered from various sources.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the church occurs in the <i>Registrum de
Dunfermelyn</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> under the years 1124-1127, when it was granted by David
<small>I.</small>, with its property and tithes, to the Abbey of Dunfermline.</p>

<p>Between the years 1189 and 1199 William the Lion granted a charter to
Henry Bald of “that land which is in the front of the street, which
leads from the Church of St. John Baptist to the Castle of Perth, on the
east side opposite to the house of Andrew, the son of Simon.” The same
Henry Bald granted, about the year 1225, to the Abbey of Scone “these
two booths which are in the front of the street which leads from the
Church of St. John Baptist towards the Castle of Perth, on the east side
opposite to the house of Andrew, the son of Simon; those two booths, to
wit, which are towards the north.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The Church of St. John the Baptist was consecrated by David de Bernham,
Bishop of St. Andrews, in 1242.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In Hay’s <i>Sacra Scotia</i> (p. 323) it
is stated that the heart of Alexander <small>III.</small> was buried in the Church of
St. John.</p>

<p>In course of time the abbots of Dunfermline allowed the building to
become ruinous, and endeavoured to lay on the citizens of Perth the
burden of upholding the fabric. It is probable that early in the
thirteenth century the Dominican Monastery was built in Perth, and about
the middle of the century the Carmelite or Whitefriars’ Monastery was
erected, and the interests of the citizens may thereby have been
diverted somewhat from the parish church. It was perhaps in connection
with the repairs required at the time that Robert the Bruce, in 1328,
granted that stones might be taken from the quarries of Kyncarachi and
Balcormac, belonging to the Abbey of Scone, “for the edification of the
Church of Perth.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span></p>

<p>In 1335 King Edward <small>III.</small> was in Perth and slew his brother, John of
Eltham, Earl of Cornwall, before the high altar of the Church of St.
John, for his excesses and ravages in the western districts of Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1379 the tomb of Robert <small>II.</small> was brought from Leith to Perth, and
temporarily deposited in St. John’s Church before being taken to the
Abbey of Scone and set up in it.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In 1393-4, after the holding of a Parliament at Scone, Walter Trail,
Bishop of St. Andrews, performed divine service in St. John’s
Church.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>From 1401 till 1553-6 there is a continuous record<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of the founding
of altars in the parish church, and of endowments to already existing
altars. In one of these, founded in 1402, it is stipulated that if the
stipend of the chaplain of St. James the Apostle should exceed a certain
sum, the excess of the endowment meant for that altar should be applied
by the Provost and Town Council “for the maintenance and reparation of
the windows and ornaments of the parish church.”</p>

<p>The chapel in which St. James’s altar was situated stood on the south
side of the church, and having fallen into a state of ruin, it had been
rebuilt about the year 1400, chiefly with the assistance which the
magistrates received from William Whitson, a wealthy burgess of Perth.</p>

<p>By a notarial instrument made in 1410, containing certain obligations
and confirmations, Euphame, Countess of Stratherne, “gave her bodily
oath on the gospels to observe the same. Done in the Parish Church of
the Burgh of Perth on St. Martin’s altar.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The foundation charter of the altar of St. John the Evangelist, founded
in 1448 by Sir John de Bute, states that the altar was situated “in the
new choir of the Parish Church.”</p>

<p>The accounts of the Lord High Treasurer contain a payment under the year
1489&mdash;“To the Kirk werk of Pertht, xviijs.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> And again in
1496&mdash;“Item, the xij day of March, in Sanct Johnstoun, giffin to the
kirk werk on the bred (altar) xjs. vjd.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Along with other offerings
at this time in St. John’s there occurs the following&mdash;“Item, that samyn
day giffin to Walter Merlioune, masoune, for his fee quhill Witsonday
nixt tocum, quhilk is the Mertymes fee bipast, xxlib.”</p>

<p>This church has the unenviable notoriety of having been the centre
whence issued, in 1559, the unruly mob who in a short time demolished
the splendid monasteries and other numerous religious houses of Perth
and the neighbourhood, and whose example was only too readily followed
by other communities throughout the whole country. Such was the effect
of a sermon preached here by John Knox. The fabric of St. John’s was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span>
spared after being purged of all monuments of idolatry. Nothing was left
but the bare walls and roofs, which were retained for use as the Parish
Church. Before the end of the century, the building was fitted up with
galleries, and in course of time it was divided into three separate
places of worship by thick walls, which still exist.</p>

<p>In 1585 the kirk-session declared the church to be in a “ruinous,
pitiful, and lamentable state,” and the minister was requested to preach
a sermon and obtain a collection for the repair of the fabric,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> but
apparently not till 1598 did “the town begin to repair the new kirk in
wallis and wandows.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The next item in the <i>Chronicle</i> regarding St.
John’s shows that the existing lead-covered spire on the central tower
is of a considerable age, for in March 1607, “Thair rais ane great
extaordinarire winde, that blew the lead of the steipill, to Mr John
Malcolme’s back yett.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> This was evidently a formidable mishap, as
ten years elapsed before the session, in 1617, “appointed David Sibbald
to be master of work to the reparation of the decayed parts of the
steeple, and to recieve furth of an chest, containing the Hospital’s
writts, the sum of £20 (Scots), left over the last collection lifted for
reparation of the kirk, and help to repair the said seeple with.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>As already mentioned, nothing now remains of the church of the twelfth
century, referred to in the earlier of the above notes, no part of the
present structure being older than the beginning of the fifteenth
century. The rebuilding of the Chapel of St. James in 1400 is spoken of
above, but that chapel no longer exists. In 1448 the east end of the
church is referred to as the “New Choir,” and we shall see as we proceed
that the other portions of the edifice are of still more recent origin.</p>

<p>The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1032">1032</a>)<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> consists of a choir and nave, with north and
south aisles, and a north and south transept without aisles. The total
length of the main building within the walls is about 191 feet by about
58 feet 9 inches wide. The nave and choir are of almost equal length.
The transept measures about 91 feet in length from north to south, by
about 23 feet 6 inches in width. There was a chapel on the west side of
the north transept, which no longer exists, but the wide arch of the
opening into it is partly visible in the transept. A view of this chapel
is given in the <i>Memorabilia of Perth</i>, of which Fig. <a href="#fig_1033">1033</a> is a copy. It
is represented as a lean-to of two stories in height, adjoining the
north transept, the upper story being evidently reached by a stair in
the erection on the west side.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, in 1448, the east end of the church is
referred to as the “New Choir,” and it is quite evident from its style<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span></p>

<p>A view of the church dated 1775, given in the <i>Chronicle of Perth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
and of which Fig. <a href="#fig_1034">1034</a> is a copy, shows the south side of the whole
church, and the transept is drawn very much as it still remains. Another
view of the south transept, made in 1765, and published in the papers
referring to the Blackfriars’ Monastery (where it is by mistake called
the “north” front), shows the south transept nearly the same as the
above.</p>

<p>A curious row of corbels is partly seen in the interior, projecting
through the plaster along the top of the east wall of this transept.
They were probably meant for supporting the upright pieces of timber
which secured the feet of the rafters.</p>

<p>The two eastern bays of the main arcade of the choir are more
elaborately moulded than the others, and round the eastmost pillar on
the south side there is finely cut the following inscription (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1035">1035</a>), which is carved on a band running round the shafts of the pier,
as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1036">1036</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>It has been recently pointed out by the Rev. John Ferguson, of
Aberdalgie,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Perthshire, that John Fullar was one of the bailies of
Perth, and that his name occurs as a witness in more than one of the
charters belonging to the Charter House, Perth, of the year 1441. His
identity is placed beyond doubt by the fact that the charges on the seal
attached to the charter are the same as those on the two shields on the
pillar, viz., a key in pale and a spur in fess. Mr Ferguson further
states:&mdash;“We know from the <i>Registrum de Dunfermline</i> that an
arrangement was made between the monastery and the magistrates of Perth,
by which the latter received</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">the tithes of Perth for six years, subject to paying the vicar and a
certain sum to the monastery, along with the fees for the right of
burial in the choir, for the purpose of building ‘Chorum, et vestibulum
ecclesie parochiale dicti burgi de Perth, prout eis placencius et
honestius videatur, ac eadem postquam fuerint edificata perpetuis
temporibus sustentabunt in omnibus et singulis reparacionibus choro et
vestibulo pertinentibus tectura,’ &amp;c. This agreement was made in 1440,
the year before John Fullar was made a bailie. It is possible that the
tithes and fees did not suffice for the execution of the work laid upon
the magistrates, and that John Fullar and his wife volunteered to pay
for a part, certainly for the pillar on which their names are
inscribed.” From this it is evident, as Mr. Ferguson remarks, that the
work of renewing the building was to be begun after 1440. It is somewhat
singular that the above two persons, who were evidently great
benefactors to this church, should have been so completely forgotten
that their good work at St. John’s required to be rediscovered and
brought to notice again here.</p>

<p>In the second bay of the choir from the east, on the north side (at B on
Plan), there is a round arched doorway, now built up. It led to the
sacristy or revestry, as it was sometimes called. After the Reformation
the sacristy was used for meetings of the kirk-session, but it was taken
down about the beginning of this century, and the meetings were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span></p>

<p>The existing north and south doorways in the choir are modern, although
the south one is in the position of the old doorway, as the print from
the <i>Chronicle</i> shows (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1034">1034</a>).</p>

<p>The choir (Fig. <a href="#fig_1038">1038</a>) has no triforium, but good plain masonry instead,
undivided by wall shafts. The clerestory windows are small and round
arched, and are divided into two lights by a central mullion, and have</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">plain tracery in the arch-head. The whole details of the choir are very
simple and refined for their period, and contrast favourably with most
of our late Scottish churches. The section (Fig. <a href="#fig_1039">1039</a>) shows that the
pillars are simply and beautifully moulded. They are surmounted with
good caps, and rest on plain bases (Fig. <a href="#fig_1040">1040</a>). The mouldings of the
arches (Fig. <a href="#fig_1041">1041</a>) are distinctly marked, and rest well on the caps
above the shafts or mouldings of the pillars. Some of these details
resemble first pointed work, especially the section of the piers which
is almost identical with that of the choir piers of St. Andrews
Cathedral, from which it is probably copied. The details of the crossing
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1042">1042</a>) are simple and effective, even as seen under the very
unfavourable circumstances that a partition wall blocks up the east
arch, and that there are galleries beneath the others. There is a west
gallery, but it is omitted in the sketch. The massive piers, with their
rounded shafts and very broad fillets, have a striking effect. The
groining is of the usual kind found in this position in Scotland. It
will be observed that in the ridge ribs, holes for bell ropes are most
carefully wrought through the ribs, which are strengthened at those
parts. The holes are not all equidistant from the centre. On the two
great western piers of the crossing there are projecting corbels to
carry the beams on which the rood was placed. Strong iron hooks are
fixed in the tower arch above, which were doubtless used for the support
of the rood, or to steady it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span></p>

<p>Of the rood itself, as a matter of course, nothing remains. The
south-west pier is built hollow to contain the stair to the tower. Since
the Plan (Fig. <a href="#fig_1032">1032</a>) was made the original doorway to this stair has
been discovered, as shown in the view. The door shown on the Plan has
been cut out at some later time.</p>

<p>As already stated, the nave is almost of the same length as the choir</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1040" style="width: 396px;">

</div>

<p>(being only about 12 inches less), but each of the arches of the arcade
is of rather smaller span than those of the choir, owing to the internal
projecting responds at the west end, which may be regarded as fulfilling
the purpose of buttresses, and also to the enlargement of the two great
piers on the west side of the crossing. Like the choir, the nave is
divided into five bays. It has no triforium nor clerestory, but owing to
the comparative lowness of the arcade arches (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1042">1042</a>), while the
ridge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span> roof throughout is kept at about the same level as in the
choir, there is a deep blank wall above the arcade arches. This wall is
of rough masonry compared to that in the choir, and the whole of this
part of the church is of a much coarser and ruder description,
betokening a later age. The capitals of the piers are of the very rudest
kind, and are a perfect contrast to the delicate work of the choir. In
the meagre descriptions of St. John’s to be found in the books on Perth,
this rudeness is pointed to as a sign of great antiquity, but the
reverse is unquestionably the case. This nave is undoubtedly “the New
Kirk of Perth” referred to in the <i>Chronicle</i>, in which “ane Synodall
assemblie” was held in April 1606.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the views (Figs. <a href="#fig_1043">1043</a> and <a href="#fig_1044">1044</a>) that the top of the
wall over the piers of the nave just shows itself and no more on the</p>

<p class="nind">outside, rising above the lean-to roof of the aisles. It has been
contemplated, early in this century, to raise this wall and erect a
clerestory, and two of the windows adjoining the tower on the north side
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_1043">1043</a>) have actually been built as part of a pretentious
design, with massive buttresses surmounted by high finials, but the work
has never been carried further, and indeed could not be carried further
to the west, as there is no proper support for such massive building.
Below the new clerestory (but not shown on the Plan) a new wall has been
brought up to support it.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_1044">1044</a> shows a peculiarity in the west wall, which seems to indicate
that there has been some change of design here, the gable being thinned
above the western doorway. There is a tradition that the church extended
further west at one time, and it seems not improbable that a western
tower in the centre of the front may have been contemplated and even
begun. This tower, like those at Stirling, Linlithgow, and Dundee, may
have been intended to open towards the church, with a wide arch, of
which the jambs still remain; but this idea having been abandoned, and
any part of the tower which then had been built having been taken down,
the present makeshift gable was put up instead to fill up the gap,
which, in these circumstances, would be left for the supposed opening
into the church.</p>

<p>There is a large porch on the north side of the nave (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1043">1043</a>),
called Halkerston’s Tower, the structure having been at one time much
higher than it is now. It was a two storied building, the upper story
having evidently been of great height and vaulted, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span> lower
one (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1033">1033</a>). Two-storied porches are met with at Aberdeen
Cathedral and Linlithgow Church, but they are not so rich in
architectural</p>

<p class="nind">was finished with a conical spirelet like the corresponding feature at
Linlithgow, and the top of it is seen in the view. The lower part of the
tower, which forms the porch, is very effectively vaulted (Fig. <a href="#fig_1045">1045</a>).
The round arched doorway leading from the porch to the church partakes
of the rudeness already referred to as characteristic of the whole
western part of the church. A curious coincidence between a part of this
church and of the Cathedrals of Dunblane and Dunkeld, all in the county
of Perth, may be referred to. The north-west window of the nave aisle in
the three buildings is treated in very much the same way in each
edifice, and these windows have all a very decided resemblance to each
other, and are quite unlike the other windows in their respective
structures. They are all three light windows, and have square heads at
Perth and Dunkeld, while at Dunblane the head is practically square,
having a very flat segmental arch. The south aisle wall of the nave
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1046">1046</a>) is a curious medley (which we hope will not be restored).
The round arched doorway near the east end is, we presume, original; but
it is not easy to tell the new work from the old, as the mouldings of
all windows and doors on the outside have received a great amount of
patching with cement and paint, owing to the crumbling nature of the
stone.</p>

<p>The erection of the west end of the church is clearly referable to about
the time (1489) when, according to the <i>Lord High Treasurer’s Accounts</i>
(already cited) small payments were made “to the kirk werk of Pertht.”
It will be remembered that on the same day the payments were made to
Walter Merlioune, the mason, and the conjunction of the two payments
suggests the idea that Merlioune was the builder of the church. We have
already partly traced his career<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and found that in all probability
he built the palace in Stirling Castle. The resemblance between the
fretted work over the panels containing statues at Stirling Castle and
that over the upper window in Halkerston’s Tower is certainly very
remarkable. There is also a resemblance in this feature of Halkerston’s
Tower to the large fretted panel over the outside of the east entrance
to Linlithgow Palace. At Linlithgow the panel is filled with heraldic
emblems, while at Perth it appears to have been intended to fill it with
statues, as indications of brackets for supporting them are shown in
three rows. There was a John Halkerston, “master of the work” to Mary of
Gueldres at the building of Trinity College Church, Edinburgh, between
1461 and 1469. It is quite possible that he may in some way have been
connected with the erection of the nave of St. John’s, and so his name
became attached to this tower as it was to a steep wynd in Edinburgh.
However this may be, all the details of the western part of this church
obviously belong to a late period, corresponding with above date.</p>

<p>The central tower (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1046">1046</a>), which is about 31 feet square, could
only have been built after the adjoining part of the nave was reared.
It<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span> is a very simple structure, with one window in each face. The
parapet and corbelling were renewed about forty years ago, following in
the main</p>

<p class="nind">the old details, which were, however, much obliterated. A good deal of
the stone facing was renewed at the same time.</p>

<p>The exterior of the church has been considerably altered and <i>improved</i>
at various times. An open parapet has been carried along the top of the
walls of the choir over the clerestory windows, and also along the walls
of the aisles and up the sloping gables of the east end. Dormer windows
to light the presbyterian galleries break in on this parapet on the
aisle walls, and windows for the same purpose, constructed of wood, are
seen on the roofs of the nave (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1046">1046</a>). These dormer windows are
all shown on the print in the <i>Chronicle of Perth</i> (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1034">1034</a>), but
not the parapets. This print shows a large and very elaborate porch,
with a round arched doorway of many orders richly ornamented, as
occupying the eastmost bay of the choir. This was originally the gateway
or porch of the Carthusian Monastery of Perth, which, after the
demolition of the abbey in 1559, was set up in this position, where it
remained till about the end of the eighteenth century, “when it was
demolished by an edict of the Magistrates.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The effect of the interior of St. John’s is greatly marred by the cross
partitions already referred to. This is much to be regretted, as the
interior is exceedingly interesting, and, being in a comparatively fair
state of preservation, exhibits more of its original features than the
exterior does. When the church was complete, the effect of the gloomy
nave, with its lofty unpierced wall above the main arcade, and the noble
centre crossing, with the light refined choir beyond, must have been
very striking and grand.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the church and another resemblance to the nave of
Dunblane and the north nave aisle of Dunkeld is the absence of vaulting
in the aisles which many of our Scottish churches have. The aisles in
St. John’s never were vaulted, the only parts so constructed being the
crossing and the north porch; the latter, it will be remembered, having
also an upper vaulted story. This want of vaulting is a great defect of
the church.</p>

<h2><a name="DUNDEE_CHURCH_TOWER" id="DUNDEE_CHURCH_TOWER"></a>DUNDEE CHURCH TOWER.</h2>

<p>The earliest notice in history of Dundee occurs in the first charter of
Lindores Abbey, executed before 1198, in which the Church of Dundee is
bestowed on the abbey. The church then existing is stated to have been
erected by Earl David of Huntingdon, as a thankoffering for his escape
from a great tempest. The Church of Dundee thus belonged to the Abbey of
Lindores, which stood on the opposite side of the Frith of Tay, and a
little further up the river.</p>

<p>In the time of Abbot James of Rossy (1442), an agreement was entered
into between the abbot and the Provost and Burgesses of Dundee, by which
the latter took on themselves the construction and maintenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span></p>

ancient parish church which now remains is the western tower (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1047">1047</a>). Although this structure had no immediate connection with the
choir, it has evidently, as its style shows, been erected about the
middle of the fifteenth century, probably about the time when the choir
was built by the Provost and Burgesses in terms of the above agreement.</p>

<p>Three parish churches in connection with the tower were gradually
developed from the original chapel. They comprised a large cruciform</p>

<p class="nind">structure, the various portions of which were called St. Mary’s, or the
East Church; St. Paul’s, or the South Church; and St. Clement’s, or the
West Church. The structure was greatly damaged by the English before the
Union, and St. Clement’s had suffered so much that it required to be
rebuilt in 1789. The three churches were almost totally destroyed by
fire in 1841, and in consequence the choir and transepts were thereafter
rebuilt, St. Mary’s still occupying the choir, St. Paul’s the transept,
and St. Clement’s the nave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span></p>

<p>The ancient tower has escaped these various destructions and
restorations, and is now the only representative of the church erected
in the fifteenth century. It is a large and massive structure, measuring
about 40 feet square over the walls (Fig. <a href="#fig_1048">1048</a>), which are about 8 feet
thick. Its total height is about 165 feet. The tower forms a prominent
object in all views of the town. It contains in the lower stage the

<p class="nind">doorway to St. Clement’s Church, or the nave (Fig. <a href="#fig_1049">1049</a>), consisting of
two round arched doorways, 8 feet 11 inches high, comprised within a
larger circular or elliptical arch, which again is enclosed by a square
moulding. The arch mouldings are enriched with foliage. The jambs and
central pillar are moulded (Fig. <a href="#fig_1050">1050</a>) with alternate rounds and
hollows. The carved capitals have a continuous abacus, enriched either
with rosettes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span> or flowing foliage. In the spandril over the centre shaft
there is a circular panel, enclosing the Virgin and Child; and below, on
a shield, are the arms of the Diocese of Brechin. “The late Bishop
Forbes blazoned them <i>Argent</i>, three piles in point gules; but Dr.
Woodward thinks they should be <i>Or</i>, three piles in point gules.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
This doorway, as well as much else about the tower, was greatly restored
by Sir Gilbert Scott, and probably only certain of the carvings are
genuine. One of these, which has not been touched, represents, on the
ingoing of the northern capital, a boar eating acorns from a branch. It
is quite in the spirit of such scenes as occur on the ancient sculptured
stones which are so abundant in the neighbourhood of Dundee. The base is
peculiar (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1050">1050</a>). It projects but little beyond the outer member
of the jamb, and the face is upright; but considerable effect is
obtained by the curved terminations of the various members. Above the
doorway rises a lofty traceried</p>

<p class="nind">window (Fig. <a href="#fig_1051">1051</a>) divided, in the late Scottish mode, by a large
central mullion having two arched branches which form two principal
openings, each filled with late tracery of the ordinary kind. Above this
window the tower is vaulted. In connection with this vaulting and what
appears to have been an apartment below it there are some peculiarities.
The floor of the tower is about 12 inches lower than the ground at the
entrance, and the height from the floor to the groined ceiling is about
47 feet. It will be observed from the Plan and Fig. <a href="#fig_1051">1051</a> that at each of
the four corners there is a large circular shaft, measuring about 13¼
inches diameter. Each individual shaft is fitted into its position in a
manner different from the others. These differences are not of a slight
or accidental kind, but appear to have been purposely made, there not
having been any “restoration” on this part of the building. At the inner
or eastern shafts (Fig. <a href="#fig_1052">1052</a>) the walls are considerably bevelled
towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">the opening into the nave, and form parts of the piers of the great
archway from the tower into the church. This opening, which is now
blocked up, was about 17 feet 10 inches wide, and was arched beneath the
vaulting (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1052">1052</a>). The tall angle shafts have bases and caps, the
mouldings of the latter being continued along the bevelled walls.</p>

<p>The vaulting ribs do not spring directly from the four angle shafts, as
there appears to have been an intermediate floor of timber (or a gallery
along the sides), which rested on the angle shafts and on large corbels
visible in the side walls. Over each of the main shafts there rises, for
about three feet or so, a group of very delicate shafting, having carved
caps, from which spring the ribs of the groining. These delicate shafts
are quite a contrast to the massive lower shafts, and, at first sight,
suggest the idea of a great change having been effected in the vaulting
at some later period. The mouldings above the small upper shafts are
carried along the west wall and ingoing of the large window (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1051">1051</a>). There is a considerable resemblance between the treatment here
and that at the large west window in Paisley Abbey. There are stone
benches round three sides of the tower.</p>

<p>Over the large west window there is another window (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1047">1047</a>), with
round arch-head, entirely filled with tracery, composed of small cusped
circles, and above it a two-light pointed window. The tracery in the
first of these windows recalls that in the tower windows of Iona
Cathedral.</p>

<p>The tower is divided into two principal stages by an enriched parapet
and outside passage, which surround it above the last mentioned window,
at a height to the walk of about 96 feet. The parapet is pierced with
quatrefoils and ornamented with crocketed pinnacles. The lower stage of
the tower has boldly projected buttresses, which are just carried as
high as is necessary for resisting the pressure of the vaulting, and
each is crowned with a crocketed pinnacle, having a small flying
buttress attached. Above these buttresses the tower is carried up with
square angles, like most of the Scottish towers of the period. The upper
stage has the wall set back, so as to allow of the passage round, and is
divided into two stories. The lower story is the belfry and has triple
pointed and cusped openings in the various sides, except the north side,
where, owing to the space occupied by the staircase, there are only two
openings. There is a bead on the angles of this story. The upper story
appears to project slightly over the lower story, and contains two
pointed and cusped windows over the solids, between the windows beneath
them. The north side has only one such window. The tower is crowned with
a cornice and an elaborate pierced parapet, having corbelled pinnacles
at intervals, the ornamental upper parts of which are unfortunately
wanting. The ornamentation of the parapet strongly resembles that of the
tower of St. Giles’, Edinburgh. The roof of the tower is of the
saddle-back kind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1053" style="width: 330px;">

<p class="nind">having gables towards the east and west, a form of roof with which
ancient Scottish towers were often crowned.</p>

<p>Although the tower is thus finished, a careful examination shows that it
was undoubtedly meant to have an open crown termination, but for what
reason the idea was abandoned we cannot tell. The preparations exist for
the springing of the angle arches. When the tower lately underwent
renovation, it was proposed to remove the present cape house and put up
a crown; and a design for this was prepared, and is engraved in Lamb’s
<i>Book of Old Dundee</i>. Very fortunately the design was not carried out.</p>

<p>Attached to the north-east angle is a boldly projected stair turret,
which ascends from the foundation to the summit. Figs. 1047 and 1053
illustrate this feature. The pierced parapet at the top returns round
it, and the turret is finished with a pointed roof. A great many
loopholes in the turret show the number of the winding spirals of the
staircase. In the view (Fig. <a href="#fig_1053">1053</a>) there is seen on the east side of the
tower a plain, square-headed window, having four brackets arranged
around it. We presume these were for supporting figures. Beneath them,
and near the ridge of the church roof, there is a panel with a coat of
arms, which is too far off to be made out.</p>

<p>This tower is undoubtedly the boldest and most striking edifice of its
kind and date in Scotland.</p>

<h2><a name="GLENLUCE_ABBEY_Wigtonshire" id="GLENLUCE_ABBEY_Wigtonshire"></a>GLENLUCE ABBEY, <span class="smcap">Wigtonshire</span>.</h2>

<p>This abbey, like so many others, stands in a fertile holm or flat ground
in the quiet valley of the Water of Luce, about one mile and a half from
the town of Glenluce. Although sometimes called <i>Vallis Lucis</i>, the name
is probably the same as Luss in Dumbartonshire, meaning a place of
herbs. The abbey was founded in 1190 by Roland, Lord of Galloway, and
colonised by Cistercians from Melrose.</p>

<p>The buildings were at one time “extensive and magnificent,” but the
ruins are now very scanty. Of the church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1054">1054</a>) there remain only
parts of the south wall of the choir and the south wall of the south
transept. The cloister enclosure is still marked by a good wall, but of
the conventual buildings which formerly surrounded it, only the chapter
house and some vaulted cellars on the east side survive.</p>

<p>The existing ruins cover about an acre of ground, but formerly the
enclosure of the garden and orchard extended to twelve Scotch acres.</p>

<p>Little is known of the annals of the monastery. Its earliest charter is
by Robert <small>I.</small>, granting the property of the abbey to be held as a free
barony, and this was confirmed by David <small>II.</small> At the Reformation the lands
were leased at a low rate to the Earl of Cassilis, who was created<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span></p>

together with the chapter house, the walls of the cloyster, the
gatehouse with the walls of the large precincts, are for the most part
yet standing.”</p>

<p>So far as can now be ascertained from the ruins, the church (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1054">1054</a>) seems to have comprised a nave with aisles about 90 feet in
length,</p>

<p class="nind">now entirely destroyed; a transept, of which part of the southern arm
with its eastern aisle or chapels remains; and an aisleless choir, of
which only a fragment of the south wall survives. From Symson’s
statement, above quoted, there was also a steeple, but whether over the
crossing or not does not now appear. To the south of the nave lay the
cloisters, the walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span> of which (partly old and partly reconstructed) now
subsist, and enclose a space measuring 89 feet from north to south by 86
feet from east to west. The north, west, and south sides are enclosed
with a stone wall, and on the east side there is a row of structures
comprising the chapter house in the centre, a ruined heap on the north
side of the chapter house, and two cellars with plain barrel vaults on
the south side.</p>

<p>The chapter house (Fig. <a href="#fig_1055">1055</a>) is the only portion of the abbey in good
preservation. It consists of an apartment about 24 feet square, with a
central pillar, from which spring the ribs of the groined vaulting. At
the side walls the ribs rest on corbels. The apartment is lighted with
two traceried windows (Fig. <a href="#fig_1056">1056</a>), the tracery of which has been renewed
within recent years, after the pattern of the old tracery. The door
enters from the cloister on the west. It is of semicircular form (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1057">1057</a>), and exhibits in its capitals some peculiar and striking
sculpture. The leaves of the foliage are large and the design is
remarkable, some of the leaves, which are probably intended to represent
sun flowers, having very much the appearance of starfish. The interior
of the chapter house doorway (Fig. <a href="#fig_1058">1058</a>) has also some peculiar
sculpture, and the manner in which the ribs of the vaults descend on the
round arch-head is well managed.</p>

<p>Corbel in Chapter House.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The stone benches which surrounded the chapter house, including the
abbot’s chair between the two windows (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1055">1055</a>), are much
destroyed, but the central pillar and the vaulting are well preserved.
The capital of the pillar is carved with foliage of a late character,
and the corbels supporting the ribs of the vaults at the wall show
similar work. One of these corbels is quaintly carved, in imitation of a
figure clothed in the costume of the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1059">1059</a>), thus giving an indication of the date of the building. From
this and the work on the doorway above referred to, as well as the
character of the work generally, we have no hesitation in fixing the
date of this part of the abbey about the end of the fifteenth century.
The bosses of the vaults are carved with various devices, one of them
bearing a lion rampant, which is probably meant to represent the arms of
the founder, the Lord of Galloway.</p>

<p>The design of the tracery in the windows (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1056">1056</a>) is good for the
period. It is remarkably like that of the chapter house at Crosraguel
Abbey, which was also fifteenth century work.</p>

<p>This sketch likewise shows the small portions of the church which still
remain. The lofty south gable of the transept is visible with the
sloping water table of the roof of the building, which stood on the
south of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span> This building has apparently been at least two stories in
height. It no doubt extended over the chapter house wing, and contained
the dormitory, &amp;c. (as at Crosraguel). A small lancet window on each
side of the water table near its apex and another small window over it
seem to indicate that there was an apartment in the roof of the
transept. The wall seen in the distance is part of the south wall of the
choir. It contains the water table of the roof of the east aisle of the
transept, and is broken off at the jamb of a high window, which lighted
the choir or presbytery, thus showing that the latter must have extended
further eastward than the existing ruin.</p>

<h2><a name="TORPHICHEN_CHURCH_Linlithgowshire" id="TORPHICHEN_CHURCH_Linlithgowshire"></a>TORPHICHEN CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Linlithgowshire</span>.</h2>

<p>This church, from the circumstance of its castle-like appearance and its
possessing a complete dwelling-house over the transepts, was included in
<i>The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland</i>, Vol. <small>II.</small> p.
131, in which a full description of it is given, illustrated with
numerous drawings. The building is here introduced with the view of more
fully explaining some features formerly omitted, and also to form a
complete record of such an important example.</p>

<p>The new features introduced in the Plan (Fig. <a href="#fig_1060">1060</a>) are the choir, the
nave, and an outbuilding to the north. The width and height of the choir
and the arch leading into it are clearly seen against the central tower
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1061">1061</a>), while the lower part of the east wall and part of the north
wall of the choir are still standing, as shown in the Plan, although
reduced to only a few feet in height.</p>

<p>The present parish church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1062">1062</a>) occupies the site of the nave, the
ancient splayed base being utilised in the north wall, where it is
visible along the whole length. It is also probable that the west end of
the present church corresponds with the position of the old west end. In
that case the dimensions were as follow, viz.:&mdash;The choir was about 63
feet 6 inches long by 25 feet 6 inches wide, and the nave was about 65
feet 6 inches long by 25 feet wide. The total length of the church was
158 feet 3 inches outside measure. The total length of the transept was
about 68 feet. There was apparently an aisle along the south side of the
nave, the beginning of the wall of which is visible on the Plan. A row
of buildings existed as a continuation northwards of the north transept,
and at a distance of about 31 yards northwards a portion of these
buildings still remains, measuring about 40 feet in length. The first
erection to the north of the transept had a window with stone seats
looking into the church, and it had also a communication with the house
over the church. There may thus have been a row of dormitories on the
upper floor extending northwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ST_ANTHONYS_CHAPEL_Edinburgh" id="ST_ANTHONYS_CHAPEL_Edinburgh"></a>ST. ANTHONY’S CHAPEL, <span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>.</h2>

<p>This edifice occupies a very picturesque situation on the summit of a
crag in the bosom of Arthur’s Seat, not far above the base of the hill.
Immediately to the north and west of the walls the ground descends in an
abrupt and precipitous manner, and to the south the surface, which
gradually rises, is rough and rocky (Fig. <a href="#fig_1066">1066</a>); while on the east a
huge wall of rock towers high above the building, completely hemming it
in on that side.</p>

<p>Only the north wall of the chapel and the returns of the west and east
walls remain, together with the foundations of the south wall, enough,
however, to enable it to be determined fairly well what the completed
building was like. In the drawings (Fig. <a href="#fig_1067">1067</a>) the indications existing
are completed and restored, so as to give a better idea of what the
structure was like than can be done by description alone. The present
condition of the edifice is shown in the ground Plan, section from east
to west and north elevation (Fig. <a href="#fig_1068">1068</a>), and in the general view from
south-east (Fig. <a href="#fig_1069">1069</a>). The building measures on the outside 43 feet in
length by 18 feet 3 inches in width, but the internal dimensions of the
chapel proper (see Plan) are only 32 feet 9 inches by 12 feet.</p>

<p>The chapel (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1068">1068</a>) was divided into three bays by a vaulted and
groined ceiling, portions of the ribs of which, with their corbel
supports, still exist in the north wall. The height of the vaulting at
the wall is about 14 feet.</p>

<p>There was a window in the central and eastern bay of the north wall, and
a doorway in the west bay, and, according to Maitland,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the same
arrangement existed on the south side. There is a locker in the usual
place at the east end of the north wall. Maitland further says that in
the “southern wall near the altar is a small arched niche, wherein was
put the holy water.” This, however, does not now exist. There was a
priest’s house over the western bay, the size of which can still be
determined by the existing return of its east wall, as seen in the north
elevation, and the longitudinal section. Part of the building, at the
west end, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span> ground floor, was screened off from the chapel by a
partition wall, of which the indications exist. On the ground floor this
was vaulted, as shown by</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1066" style="width: 501px;">

</div>

<p class="nind">section at tower, and contained a locker. Within this space at the
south-west corner there was, doubtless, a wheel stair, which by the
first revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span> led to an entresol over the arched space just referred
to. This entresol was probably a garderobe, and was lighted by a small
window, shown on the Plans and Section. The stair, continuing upwards,
would land at the first floor over the chapel, which consisted of a room
about 15 feet by 13 feet, lighted by a north window. Adjoining this
window a portion of the north wall is thinned by about 15 inches at the
floor level so as to form a recess, which contains a window. Over this
the wall is carried at its usual thickness by a half arch, as shown by
the longitudinal section. Probably this recess was screened off from the
room to form a small closet. There was a fireplace in the west gable;
part of its flue still remains, with one of its corbels for supporting
the lintel and chimney breast. In the restored drawing (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1067">1067</a>)
it is supposed that there was an upper room. Assuming that the</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1067" style="width: 469px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1067.</span>&mdash;St. Anthony’s Chapel. Suggested Restoration.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">first floor room was 10 feet high in the ceiling&mdash;and it is not likely
to have been higher&mdash;the height of the existing wall at the north-west
corner warrants this assumption, as above the 10 feet level it rises 3
feet more in its present broken down condition. That it rose to a higher
level than it does now is almost certain, in which case an upper room
would be obtained, as shown by section at tower (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1067">1067</a>). This
corresponds with Maitland, who says that the tower was perhaps upwards
of 40 feet in height. The second floor room would, of course, be reached
by a continuation of the stair. At the staircase landing a small outside
bartizan is introduced in the restored drawing, such as is frequently
found in the pele towers. This arrangement of the two upper rooms is
similar to what is found in the church of the Carmelite Friars at South
Queensferry and at Torphichen, both of the same period as St. Anthony’s.
There is also, but on a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span> elaborate scale, something of the same
arrangement at Stobhall in Perthshire, already illustrated.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>To the south and west of the chapel there are remains of walls, and
particularly of what is called the hermitage (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1066">1066</a>); but these
are very fragmentary, and so intermixed with the natural rock, which
crops up everywhere, that not much can be made out in connection with
them.</p>

<p>Of the origin of the chapel nothing appears to be known, and almost the
same may be said of its history. One of the earliest notices of it&mdash;if
not the earliest&mdash;occurs in the <i>Treasurer’s Accounts</i> of 1473, as
follows&mdash;“Item, vj<sup>to</sup> Februarij, to offir in Sanct Antonis in the
crag, to the King, xijs.” In the same accounts it is again referred to
in 1491 and 1496&mdash;“Item,</p>

chapel, besid Edinburgh, to the Kings offerand ixs.” Again in 1498, the
King (James <small>IV.</small>) made an offering in “Sanct Anthonis of the crag of xjs.
viijd.”</p>

<p>An exhaustive review of the present condition of the chapel and
hermitage, and an account of the various references to them by different
writers, has been prepared by Mr. Fred. R. Coles.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Mr Coles gives

<p>Grose states that hermitages were frequently erected on the sea coast,
and at dangerous places, and that the patron or tutelary saint of these
hermitages was St. Anthony the hermit, and suggests that the situation
of St. Anthony’s on the crag which stands conspicuous from the Firth of
Forth</p>

<p class="nind">was perhaps chosen with the intention of attracting the notice of seamen
coming up the Firth, who, in cases of danger, might be induced to make
vows to its tutelar saint. There is a fine spring of clear water close
to the site, which may have led to the establishment of the hermitage
there. The building contains almost no features by which its date can be
ascertained, but it is here classed along with the buildings of the
third period, to some of which it bears in certain respects an analogy.</p>

<p>The village of Rosslyn is picturesquely situated on the high north bank
of the river North Esk, about seven miles south from Edinburgh; and the
ancient castle of the St. Clairs<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> stands on an isolated promontory

<p class="nind">into the deep valley of the Esk. The celebrated Church of Rosslyn,
erected by the proprietors of the castle, stands on the brow of the
steep bank of the river above the castle, and commands a splendid view
of the valley. The church, so far as erected, is in perfect
preservation, and is a charming portion of an incomplete design. It is,
in some respects, the most remarkable piece of architecture in Scotland;
and had the church been finished in the same spirit as that in which it
has been so far carried out, it would have gone far to have realised a
poet’s dream in stone. When looked at from a strictly architectural
point of view, the design may be considered faulty in many respects,
much of the detail being extremely rude and debased, while as regards
construction many of the principles wrought out during the development
of Gothic architecture are ignored. But notwithstanding these faults,
the profusion of design so abundantly shown everywhere, and the
exuberant fancy of the architect, strike the visitor who sees Rosslyn
for the first time with an astonishment which no familiarity ever
effaces.</p>

<p>The principal authority regarding the history of the church and the
family of the St. Clairs of Rosslyn is Father Richard Augustin Hay,
prior of St. Pieremont, whose mother, by a second marriage, became wife
of Sir James St. Clair of Rosslyn. About the year 1700, Father Hay made
copious extracts from the family documents, which have been since lost,
and these extracts, together with his comments, have been published
under the title of the <i>Genealogie of the Sainteclaires of Rosslyn,
including the chartulary of Rosslyn</i>.</p>

<p>The edifice was erected by Sir William St. Clair, third Earl of Orkney,
who succeeded to the estates about 1417. About thirty years afterwards
he founded the Collegiate Church of Rosslyn. Certain letters which occur
on shields along the cornice of the north wall have been ingeniously
deciphered by Dr. Thomas Dickson, of the Register House, Edinburgh, as
the initial letters of the following words,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> viz.:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wilzame · Lorde ·
Sinclare · Fundit · Yis · College · Ye · Zeir · of · God</span> · <small>MJJJJL</small>. The
structure appears, however, to have been begun a few years earlier,
about 1446, as in the year 1447 the continuator of the <i>Scotichronicon</i>
says, “Dominus Willelmus de Sancto Claro Comes Orcadiæ <i>est in
fabricando sumptuosam structuram apud Roslyn</i>;”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and probably the
foregoing inscription refers to some ceremonial event connected with the
building. Sir William died in 1484, and he appears to have left the
building very much in the condition in which we now find it. In that
case its erection would be the labour of about forty years.</p>

<p>The church was a collegiate foundation, for a provost, six prebendaries,
and two singing boys or choristers, and was dedicated to St. Matthew. It
consists (Fig. <a href="#fig_1070">1070</a>) of a choir with north and south aisles, connecte<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span>d</p>

<p class="nind">by an aisle which runs across the east end, and gives access to a series
of four chapels beyond it to the east. The dimensions of the building
are as follow, viz.:&mdash;interior&mdash;length of choir, 48 feet 4 inches; width
of central aisle, 17 feet 10½ inches; width over aisles, 35 feet; total
exterior length, 69 feet 8 inches; height to the apex of the roof, 41
feet 9 inches. The original intention was to have completed the building
as a cross church, with choir, nave, and transepts, but the choir only
has been completed. The transepts have been partly erected, the east
wall being carried up to a considerable height, but the nave has not
been erected. The length across the transepts, as founded, is about 72
feet. Mr Thomson, the custodier of the chapel, who saw the west walls of
the transept exposed, states that the transepts were intended to be 18
feet wide, as drawn on Plan. The Rev. Mr. Thompson, Rosslyn, in his
guide to the chapel, says that the foundations for the entire building
had been laid, and that those of the nave, which extended to about 91
feet to the west, were dug up and exposed at the beginning of the
present century. This exactly corresponds with the length which the
nature of the ground would permit.</p>

<p>The choir, both internally and externally, is remarkably symmetrical,
the bays being all of the same dimensions, with only slight differences
in the carving, which do not affect the general design. Thus (Fig. <a href="#fig_1071">1071</a>)
all the buttresses rise unbroken by set-offs to the wall head of the
aisles, where the cornice continues round them, and they have all on the
face canopies of the same size and style. Above the cornice on the ten
buttresses on the north and south sides of the choir there rise on each
two massive pinnacles, connected by a small flying buttress between them
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1072">1072</a>). The outer pinnacles, which are flush with the face of the
buttresses, are square on Plan, and are decorated according to two
alternate patterns (Fig. <a href="#fig_1073">1073</a>), viz., canopied niches in the one, and
large rosettes set in hollows in the other. The inner pinnacles (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1074">1074</a>), which rest on the thickness of the wall, are all practically
alike. They are oblong on Plan, and are so placed as to offer most
resistance to the flying buttresses, which are thrown across the aisles
and rest upon them. The pinnacles are ornamented with rosettes on the
angles, and crockets on the sloping top. The back of these pinnacles and
the lower parts, where not seen from below, are left plain, without any
ornament. The flying arches abutting against the pinnacles are carved
with a revived Norman-like chevron.</p>

<p>The pinnacles (Fig. <a href="#fig_1075">1075</a>) on the buttresses of the east chapels are
naturally somewhat different, as they have no thrusts from flying
buttresses to counteract. There is only one pinnacle on each of these
buttresses, and although they are all of different design, their effect
corresponds with that of the outer pinnacles of the aisles of the choir.
The back of these pinnacles is left unfinished (Fig. <a href="#fig_1076">1076</a>), like those
at the sides, but the portions visible are very elaborately carved.</p>

<p>The windows of the aisles (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1072">1072</a>) are all of two lights, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">moulding connects them, which in the arches is always filled with
carving. In the jambs there are two different patterns in the alternate
windows, the one being a simple niche with canopy and bracket for a
figure, and the other the same, but with a moulded block instead of the
figure. There is very little variety in the tracery. The windows on each
side correspond with those on the opposite side. In the eastern chapels
four of the windows have the engrailed cross of the St. Clairs wrought
into the tracery.</p>

<p>The clerestory windows (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1072">1072</a>) are all after one design, the
shafts, mouldings, and arches on the outside being repeated in the
interior (Fig. <a href="#fig_1078">1078</a>). These are similar to those of the aisle windows
just described. Their decoration consists of large rosettes, occurring
at regular intervals in the hollow moulding between the shafts of the
jambs. All the clerestory windows are single lights. The tracery of the
large window in the east end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1077">1077</a>) is modern. Its design is
probably founded on ancient remains, but whether or not it accords well
with the rest of the building.</p>

<p>The north and south doorways, which are opposite each other, are
recessed in quasi porches (see Figs. <a href="#fig_1072">1072</a> and <a href="#fig_1073">1073</a>)), formed by round
arches thrown between the buttresses, and the minor differences of the
doorways are shown in the sketches. The upper part of a window appears
over each, as in the south doorway of Glasgow Cathedral. The aisle roofs
being flat, there is no triforium or blind story, and the clerestory
windows are carried down to the string course over the main arches (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_1078">1078</a>).</p>

<p>Turning now to the interior, it will be observed that the main piers are
composed of a series of round mouldings, separated by slight square
fillets, and that the corresponding wall shafts or responds (Fig. <a href="#fig_1079">1079</a>)
are of trefoil form, with good caps and carved bases, which rest on the
side bench. The arch mouldings of the main arcade (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1078">1078</a>) are
shallow, with regularly recurring orders of decoration, each arch having
an enriched hood moulding. The upper part of the wall slightly overhangs
on a bold carved and moulded string course. The wall space between the
clerestory windows is ornamented with two canopies and massive brackets
placed one over the other.</p>

<p>The choir roof, which consists of a pointed barrel vault (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1080">1080</a>), is divided by strengthening ribs into compartments corresponding
with the bays, and each compartment is decorated differently (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1078">1078</a>). The dividing ribs are moulded, and have large projecting cusps in
the form of fleurs-de-lys, &amp;c., on the soffit. The compartments of the
roof are entirely “powdered with stars” or rosettes, set square or
diagonally. The construction of the aisle roofs is peculiar, although
something similar is frequent in castles, as will be afterwards alluded
to. A regularly constructed straight arch with proper radiating joints,
concealed behind upright joints, spans each aisle (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1079">1079</a>) from
pillar to wall shaft. These horizontal arches or lintels have flat
relieving arches over them, which in some instances are visible. The
aisles are roofed with a series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span></p>

cross, the one limb running along the crown of each arch, and the other
downwards from this on each side. But in the north and south aisles, in
the three bays west from the doorways, the engrailed band is only
continued along the crown of the arch, the other limb being omitted,
which may possibly be meant to distinguish the more sacred part of the
edifice.</p>

<p>The eastern chapels are the only part of the building in which there is
groined vaulting. The compartments are oblong, and have pointed cross
arches (Fig. <a href="#fig_1083">1083</a>), the diagonals meeting at the apex. Elaborately
carved pendants, about 4 feet long, occupy the place of the usual boss;
while at the springing of the arches, against the east wall, great
projecting horns, resting on curved corbellings or cones above the caps
of the wall shafts, radiate outwards and downwards, one horn to each
rib, so that they are in groups of three.</p>

Carving of Straight Arches.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The object of these curved cones, with their projecting horns, may be
explained as follows:&mdash;It will be seen on referring to the Plan (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_1070">1070</a>) that the centre line of the east chapels is not in the centre
of the space between the two eastmost buttresses, and consequently not
in line with the centre of the north and south windows between those
buttresses. In order to make the centre line of the vaulting coincide
with the centre of the windows, it was necessary to introduce some kind
of support for the foot of the east arches, at a distance of about 2 or
3 feet from the east wall. The above cones and horns were introduced for
this purpose, and from them the vaulting on the east side springs. In
connection with this arrangement, the late David Roberts, R.A.,
contended that the “east wall of Rosslyn had been pulled down and set
further back, to give 3 feet more room.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> But this supposition finds
no warrant whatever from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span> examination of the building. A more likely
explanation is that the above cones may have been introduced as a kind
of imitation of the springing of</p>

<p class="nind">the fan vaulting common in England in the fifteenth century. The heavy
pendants were also probably derived from the same source.</p>

<p>Against the east wall of the choir were the remains of four altars,
which have been restored (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1083">1083</a>), one of them being situated
over the stair leading to the lower chapel. Beside it there is a square
headed piscina, and on the south side of the other altars there are ogee
headed recesses in the wall. On the east side of the south doorway there
is a richly carved stoup.</p>

<p>In the transepts (Fig. <a href="#fig_1084">1084</a>) there are remains of three canopied
piscinas, two in the south transept and one in the north transept. They
bear a general resemblance in their details to the sacrament houses in
some of the churches in the north, and to the piscinas in Melrose Abbey.
Between the two in the south transept there is a recess in the wall,
showing where an altar has been intended, and a similar indication in
the north transept on the north side of the piscina shows the same
intention. Over each of these altars there are three moulded and carved
brackets, probably meant for statues. On the south side of the centre
opening into the choir there is a recess for another altar, and on the
north side there is an arched piscina; both have carved brackets above
them. A bracket in a similar position, relative to the altar and
piscina, exists at Dunglass Church.</p>

<p>A singular feature of the church, which would have been more apparent
had it been finished, is that the choir is almost cut off by a solid
wall from what would have been the other divisions of the structure.
Fig. <a href="#fig_1084">1084</a> shows the wall as seen from the outside. The openings into the
side aisles are about 4 feet 3 inches wide and about 11 feet high, and
the opening on the ground level into the central aisle is about 7 feet
wide. These three openings are all covered with straight arches. Above
the central opening there is a lofty aperture like a window covered with
a pointed arch, probably meant to contain the rood. Above the caps of
the jambs of the side openings there are two carved figures (Fig. <a href="#fig_1085">1085</a>),
that on the north being St. Sebastian, and that on the south St.
Christopher.</p>

<p>Beyond the east end of the church and on a lower level, so as to suit
the slope of the ground (Fig. <a href="#fig_1086">1086</a>), a chapel has been erected, which is
reached from the south aisle by a straight stair of twenty-five steps.
This chapel measures 36 feet in length from east to west by 14 feet
wide. It is barrel vaulted (Fig. <a href="#fig_1087">1087</a>), and is lighted by one window
only, at the east end. The window is a simple pointed one, without
tracery. There are several ambries in the walls, and an eastern altar
with a piscina. There are also a fireplace and a small closet about 11
feet square on the north side. A door leads out on the south to what has
been an open court, where there are indications of other buildings
having existed or been intended. It would thus appear that in all
probability<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span></p>

<p>This chapel or sacristy is supposed to have been built in the lifetime
of Sir William St. Clair’s first wife, Lady Elizabeth or Margaret
Douglas, daughter of Archibald, fourth Earl of Douglass, and first Duke
of Touraine, from the circumstance that her arms (Fig. <a href="#fig_1088">1088</a>) are

and 3rd quarters of the arms of the Earl of Orkney; <i>Sinister</i>, in base
a heart, and on a chief three mullets, for Douglas, the shield being
surmounted of a fess charged with three fleurs-de-lys (2 and 1) for
Touraine. Lady Elizabeth died in 1452.</p>

<p>The barrel vault of the sacristy (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1087">1087</a>) is semicircular, and
supports a flat roof formed with overlapping stones. The vault is
strengthened with transverse ribs carved with the engrailed cross, which
spring from corbels sculptured with figures of angels and saints (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1089">1089</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span></p>

<p>In considering the history of Rosslyn Church many of the statements of
Father Hay regarding the St. Clairs and Rosslyn require to be received
with considerable caution. He was a hero worshipper, and Sir William was
his hero. The latter is represented by the Father as living in more than
royal magnificence at Rosslyn, with many of the nobles of Scotland
waiting upon him as servants. That is a very incredible statement, as is
also the assertion that under the fostering care of Sir William, Rosslyn
became the “chiefest town in all Lothian, except</p>

<p>Edinburgh and Haddington.” But few who visit this chapel will be
inclined seriously to quarrel with the Father on account of his
enthusiasm for the Rosslyn family. To the purest in Gothic architecture
Rosslyn may seem barbarous and debased, but it must be allowed to be
splendid barbarism, meted out with the most liberal hand. Sir William is
further represented by Father Hay as bringing artificers from foreign
lands, and setting them to work on Rosslyn College, and on this
unsupported statement many writers have found the prototype of this
building abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span> some in France and some in Spain, and even Rome is
hinted at in the well known story of the ’Prentice Pillar. The unusual
richness of the ornamentation of the edifice, so different from most of
the structures</p>

<p class="nind">erected in this country at the time, has doubtless led to these attempts
to attribute the design to a foreign architect or a foreign country,

<p>But this amount of decoration, being so exceptional in Scottish
edifices, seems to have proved misleading. No parallel to Rosslyn has,
so far as we know, been discovered abroad, and it is unnecessary to go
so far afield in search of a model. The leading principles of the design
are really Scottish, and it will be found, on careful analysis, that
Rosslyn Church presents a rich and finished epitome, both as regards
constructive and decorative elements, of the Scottish ecclesiastical
architecture of the third or late pointed period. The plan of the east
end of Rosslyn Church so closely resembles that of the choir of Glasgow
Cathedral, that there is hardly room to doubt that the latter was the
model after which the former was designed. The disposition of the
pillars in the two buildings agrees exactly, the side aisles in both
being connected by an eastern</p>

<p><a id="fig_1089"></a></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 207px;">

<p>The Collegiate Church of Rosslyn. Corbels in Lower Chapel.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">aisle, which in each case has a central pillar in the east arcade, and
in each edifice a series of chapels beyond this aisle forms the east
end. The details are, as is natural, seeing that the buildings are about
two centuries apart in date, entirely different, but it is curious to
observe how in both cases even the minute parts of the design are
remarkably alike. Thus the triple niche over the central pillar of the
east arcade at Glasgow finds a counterpart in the same position at
Rosslyn (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1078">1078</a>). The east wall and gable of both choirs occupy
the same relative position, rising above the eastern aisle and chapels.
Churches with an eastern aisle are not unknown in England, such as Abbey
Dore, Herefordshire, and Romsey Abbey, Hampshire; but the former has
three openings in the east end, thus showing an arch in the centre;
while Romsey Church, Glasgow Cathedral, and Rosslyn Church have the
peculiarity of having a pillar in the centre of the east arcade.</p>

<p>Much has been made of the resemblance between the barrel vaults of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span>
Rosslyn and those of the south of France, but there does not appear to
be any connection between them. The pointed barrel vault was the form
commonly practised in Scotland in the fifteenth century, both in
churches and castles. Mr Fergusson says that this kind of vault is
“foreign and unlike the usual form of vaults found in Scotland,” but the
examples given in this book show that he is mistaken. Pointed barrel
vaults are to be found in the churches at Seton, Queensferry, Ladykirk,
Whitekirk, Borthwick, Crichton, Corstorphine, Dunglass, and many others,
and numerous examples might be given from the castles. There can,
therefore, be no doubt that the masons of Scotland were at this period
quite familiar with that system of vaulting, some of which, such as the
vaults of Borthwick Castle, in the same district and built a little
earlier than Rosslyn, are of considerably larger dimensions. The pointed
barrel vaults of castle halls and churches are generally covered with
sloping stone roofs, as at Bothwell, Borthwick, &amp;c., but at Rosslyn the
curved form of the roof has been adhered to, externally as well as
internally. The coping of the east gable has been finished to this curve
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_1077">1077</a>), and there is no indication of any straight roof having
been intended. It is possible, however, that it had been originally
contemplated to cover the extrados of the choir vault, which still
remains unprotected, with an outer stone roof, in accordance with the
usual practice; but, owing to the slightness of the clerestory walls,
the outer stone roof was omitted in consequence of its great additional
weight, which, it may have been believed, would be too great for the
side walls to sustain. The roofs of the aisles and east chapels, which
are almost flat, are covered with overlapping flags. Until the building
was restored some thirty years ago, these parts of the building were
covered with a temporary slated roof, which cut off one half of the
clerestory windows. The mark of this roof is still visible in the walls.</p>

<p>When we examine smaller details, we find the same methods adopted by the
Rosslyn builders as were familiar to the other builders of the country,
thus all the lintels or straight arches connecting the main pillars with
the side walls, which are such striking features at Rosslyn, are
composed of small stones, having radiating joints in the same manner as
is frequent in the lintels of the wide fireplaces in the halls of the
castles. It may also be noted that the jambs of these fireplaces often
terminate in curious moulded caps, often very clumsy, and not unlike the
caps of the responds at the east wall of Rosslyn. The plans of the
castles sometimes show a series of small parallel apartments, with
barrel vaults abutting at right angles upon a passage or wider hall,
which may have suggested the parallel barrel vaults of the aisles of
Rosslyn. But, indeed, the form of the main arcade itself suggests such
an arrangement. The carved canopies and corbels placed on the face of
the buttresses and window jambs (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1090">1090</a>) are thoroughly
characteristic of the Scottish churches<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span> of this period, and when their
general design is considered, these features at Rosslyn will be found
not to differ materially from those of the churches of Melrose,
Linlithgow, Seton, Trinity College, and other buildings. Compare the
disposition of small canopied niches round some central feature, such as
the buttress niche (Fig. 778) at Melrose, and the pinnacles (see Figs.
<a href="#fig_1075">1075</a> and <a href="#fig_1076">1076</a>)) at Rosslyn.</p>

<p>On the sides of each buttress at Rosslyn (see Figs. <a href="#fig_1072">1072</a>, <a href="#fig_1073">1073</a>, and
1091) there is a splayed moulding, a kind of set-off which runs from the
front of the buttress back to the wall, on the top of the base string
course. A somewhat similar set-off occurs on some of the buttresses of
the chapter house of Glasgow Cathedral, built a few years before
Rosslyn.</p>

<p>A large number of details from Melrose have a very decided resemblance
to those found at Rosslyn. Thus the staircase turret (Fig. 773)</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1090" style="width: 467px;">

</div>

<p class="nind">at the west side of the south transept of Melrose is in spirit so very
like the work at Rosslyn that, had it been included in the illustrations
of the latter, only those who have local knowledge would have detected
it. The same remark applies to the south doorway from Dalkeith Church,
given further on. A striking resemblance also occurs between the
mouldings of the sacristy doors at Lincluden and Bothwell and the
details of the clerestory windows at Rosslyn. In all these examples the
mouldings consist of an outer and inner shaft, separated by a large
hollow, containing carved work; and the shafts have, in every case, caps
and bases treated in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The soffit cusping so common in the arches at Rosslyn is a decoration of
the most frequent occurrence throughout Scotland; at this period,
indeed, there is hardly an arched tomb recess in the country which is
not so decorated. Carved rosettes set in hollows, which abound
everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span> at Rosslyn, are likewise the common decoration of the
period, both in churches and castles. Similar decorative enrichments are
also very common in Tudor buildings in England, as, for example, in
Henry VII.’s Chapel at Westminster, where also the small figures so
frequent at Rosslyn above the caps and on buttresses, &amp;c., find their
counterpart, thus showing an association of ideas with English rather
than foreign work.</p>

<p>The doorways at Rosslyn, with the porches formed in front of them by
arches thrown between the buttresses, are paralleled by the doorways at
Glasgow Cathedral; Trinity College, Edinburgh; and St. Salvator’s, St.
Andrews. The engrailed cross which enters so largely into the decoration
of Rosslyn, being employed all along the arched roof of the aisles and
of the lower chapel, and forming the motive for the tracery of some of
the windows at the east end, is peculiarly local, being the distinctive
feature of the St. Clair arms, while the loop tracery in many of the
windows is of common occurrence in Scotland. A number of details
illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig_1092">1092</a>, being chiefly the corbels of niches, have a
very marked resemblance to the similar carvings at Trinity College,
Edinburgh. Those containing the fox preaching to the geese and the
dromedary are specially interesting. Other examples (such as Fig. <a href="#fig_1093">1093</a>)
show that the character of the foliage is the same as that of many of
our Scottish churches. Much of the carving at Rosslyn has considerable
affinity with the late wood work in English churches (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1082">1082</a>).</p>

<p>These comparisons are probably enough to prove that Rosslyn Church was
built after the manner and style of its age and country, and only
differs from other Scottish churches of the same period in possessing a
superabundance of rich detail and carving in excess of what is usually
found.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The transepts, which project two bays to the north and south, were
obviously intended to be two stories high, and probably of the same
height as the clerestory walls of the choir. Indeed, a part of the east
wall of the north transept exists of this height. The walls of the
transept are well buttressed, as if to maintain a vault, and there are
no windows in the existing lower part of the transepts, the intention
probably being to light them with large traceried windows at each end,
as in Trinity College.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span></p>

<p>The portions of the transepts and crossing which have been completed are
too small to enable it to be clearly determined how these parts of the
structure were intended to be carried out and vaulted. The west gable</p>

<p class="nind">of the choir (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1084">1084</a>) is built with a curved outline on top,
which seems to indicate the form of an intended barrel vault. The gable
has been left unfinished, and the existing belfry is obviously a late
addition. The above curve, if completed, would comprise the full width
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">{177}</a></span> chapel, embracing both the centre aisle and the side aisles, and
would rise considerably above the apex of the roof. The space included
between the curves is about 36 feet wide, which is a wider span than
would likely be undertaken at this period. The curved form of the top of
the west wall of the choir may, therefore, be dismissed as an indication
of a probable vault.</p>

<p>Attention has already been drawn to the usual mode of finishing the
barrel vaults of churches at this period (see <i>ante</i>, page 3), viz., by
the introduction of four solid walls (with small apertures) at the four
sides of the crossing on which the barrel vaults of the various arms of
the churches were stopped. This system has, so far as the structure is
completed, been adopted at Rosslyn, the wall on the east side of the
crossing</p>

<p class="nind">being built so as to receive the barrel vault of the choir. There seems
to be no reason why the same plan should not have been intended to be
used for the completion of the other sides of the crossing. The edifice
would then be in harmony with the other collegiate churches of the
period, and may have been intended to be completed with a central tower.</p>

<p>The building shown by dotted lines at the west end is a vestry and organ
chamber erected a few years ago.</p>

<p>The sculpture with which the chapel is so profusely adorned generally
represents Scriptural scenes, and has been very minutely described by
the Rev. Mr. Thompson in his <i>Guide to Rosslyn Chapel</i>.</p>

<p>One of the most unique examples amongst the remarkable decorations of
the edifice is the ornamentation of the south pillar of the east aisle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span></p>

the wreaths corresponds in character with the other carving of the
church; and the grotesque animals on the base find a counterpart in
those of the chapter house pillar at Glasgow Cathedral.</p>

<p>Beneath the choir are the vaults in which many of the St. Clairs are
buried. The entrance is under a slab on which the incised outline of a
knight in armour is carved (Fig. <a href="#fig_1094">1094</a>), with a dog at his feet, and a

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1100.</span>&mdash;The Collegiate Church of Dunglass. Plan of
Piers of Tower.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It will be seen from the drawing (Fig. <a href="#fig_1100">1100</a>) that the plan of the tower
piers is peculiar. The two western piers stand out from the angle of the
walls of the nave and transept, to which they are attached by a strip of
masonry, only some 9 or 10 inches thick. The tower is thus considerably
off the centre of the transept, and is much less in breadth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span> than the
limbs of the cross. The two eastern piers project from the angle into
the choir, but not so as to diminish the width of the transept. It is
difficult to account for the extremely unusual and eccentric position of
the tower supports. Possibly the choir and tower were first built, and
when the nave and transepts were erected, it was thought desirable to
make them wider than at first intended. The piers of the crossing are
simply splayed and notched on the inner diagonal faces, and they are all
alike; but the arch faces or mouldings vary, those of the nave and
transepts corresponding with the piers, while the choir arch is moulded
on both faces with shallow mouldings. The former arches spring from
moulded caps (see section Fig. <a href="#fig_1100">1100</a>) and the latter from caps carved and
moulded</p>

<p>The windows in the end walls of the nave, choir, and transepts are all
pointed, and were filled with tracery; but the tracery in every case is
gone, and the west wall under the window sill has been cut out to allow
of the passage of carts and horses. Below the end windows of the
transept and sacristy are sepulchral recesses, which were probably
enriched with cusping, which is now cut away. The ornamental brackets
for supporting these enrichments have label terminations of angels. One
of these, playing on a stringed instrument, is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1102">1102</a>. The
side windows of the church have segmental sconsion arches and double
lights, with massive tracery (see Figs. <a href="#fig_1099">1099</a> and <a href="#fig_1103">1103</a>)). The north and
south doorways of the nave are round arched, with moulded jambs (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_1097">1097</a>). The other doorways are plain, with lintels.</p>

<p>The sedilia in the south wall near the east end (Figs. <a href="#fig_1103">1103</a> and <a href="#fig_1104">1104</a>) is
a very beautiful one, and is fairly well preserved. It contains the
usual three seats indicated by three ogee crocketed arch-heads. These
arches rest on carved capitals at each end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1105">1105</a>), and the
intermediate ones on corbels supported by angels, one holding a shield,
and the other playing on a voil. The sedilia is recessed about 13
inches, and is 6 feet 6¾ inches long (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1103">1103</a>) by about 5 feet 3
inches high from the seat to the springing of the arches. Between the
sedilia and the east wall and below the sill of the window there has
been a piscina, which has been cut away, and its position is merely
indicated against the wall, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1103">1103</a>. It appears to have
been supported by a shaft from the floor. Adjoining this, in the east
wall, is seen (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1104">1104</a>) a projecting corbel with a shield on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span>
face. This was probably meant either to support a light or a figure in
connection with the altar.</p>

founded by Sir Alexander Home of Home in 1403. He was the son of Sir
Thomas and Nicolas Pepdie. Sir James Hall, in a letter written in 1789
(see Hutton Collection), finds from examination, evidently of original
documents in his possession, that it was founded by Sir Alexander in
1403. Dr. Laing also adopts this date as correct.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Perhaps, as above

<p>Dunglass Church is generally regarded as having been Collegiate. In the
appendix to the <i>Scotichronicon</i>, it is stated that in the reign of
James II. the buildings of Douglas (probably a mistake for Dunglass)
were in progress,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and in the <i>Originales Parochiales</i>, Vol. <small>I.</small> p.
153, the following note occurs:&mdash;“About the middle of the fifteenth
century a petition regarding the erection of the Parish Church of
Douglas (evidently mistaken for Dunglass) into a Collegiate Church was
presented to the Apostolic See, but though the Pope’s consent seems to
have been obtained, the purpose never was fulfilled.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span></p>

<p>This edifice, which is one of the best preserved and most interesting of

<p>The lands of Fowlis came into the possession of the family of Gray by
marriage about the year 1397, when the only daughter of the last
Mortimer of Fowlis and Aberdour married Sir Andrew Gray of Broxmouth. He
was the first Lord Gray, and was succeeded by his son Andrew, the second
Lord Gray, and it was doubtless by this Andrew Gray that the church was
built. He died in 1469, and, judging from the style and various features
of the architecture, the building seems to have been erected in his
lifetime. Spottiswoode states that it was built by Sir Andrew Gray of
Fowlis during the reign of James II. (1437-1460), and there is still</p>

<p class="nind">more conclusive evidence that the church was built by Sir Andrew. He
married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Sir John Wemyss of Rires and
Kincaldrum, and the arms of Gray and Wemyss are carved on the skew
stones of the church. Further, in the <i>Old Statistical Account</i> it is
stated that the “beam which supported the organ loft” bore the
inscription:&mdash;“Hoc Templum Structum fuit Anno Millesimo Centesimo
Quadragesimo Secundo ab A. Gray.”</p>

<p>The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1107">1107</a>) is a simple oblong structure without buttresses
or projections of any kind. It measures about 88 feet long by 28 feet
wide outside the walls. It is built of fine ashlar in large courses of
stone, obtained from the den of Fowlis in the immediate neighbourhood.
The stone is of a bluish-grey colour, and has well stood the test of
time. There are north and south doors (Fig. <a href="#fig_1108">1108</a>) nearly opposite each
other near<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span></p>

The edifice was divided into a nave and chancel by a rood screen and
loft.</p>

<p>The corbels for supporting the loft still exist, as shown on the Plan
and in Fig. <a href="#fig_1109">1109</a>. The nave is lighted by a large four light window in
the west gable (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1110">1110</a>), and one narrow lofty pointed window in
the south wall (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1108">1108</a>). There are one upper and one lower window
in the south wall at the rood loft, the lower window pointed and the
other square headed, and immediately to the east, in the south wall,
another narrow and tall pointed window. Between the priest’s door and
the east gable the chancel is emphasised by a large three light
traceried window in the south wall (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1110">1110</a>), and also by a slight
rise in the base, which runs all round the church. There is a small
round window in the east wall fitted with a piece of cast iron tracery,
put in about the beginning of this century. Only one window occurs in
the north wall, viz., at the rood loft, which corresponds to the lower
window on the south side, and is furnished with similar corbels<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span> at each
side, for the support of the rood loft. There is in addition a lower
corbel a few feet west from the window, which was probably the wall rest
of the upper step of the stair leading to the loft. The south-west
doorway (Fig. <a href="#fig_1111">1111</a>) has a very impressive appearance. The jambs and arch
are moulded with two deep and wide hollows, having a filleted round
between, which terminates, like many late Gothic mouldings, on a splayed
base. The round arch is surmounted by a richly carved ogee shaped label,
resting at each side on figures bearing shields, and terminating with a
heraldic display at the top, where on a shield couché are carved the
arms of Lord Gray, namely, a lion rampant, within a bordure</p>

<p>The ambry or sacrament house stands in the east wall on the north side
of the altar. It is one of the most elaborately carved and sculptured
examples now remaining in Scotland. The sacrament house is well shown in
the drawing by Mr. Robertson (Fig. <a href="#fig_1113">1113</a>). It is 5 feet 6 inches high by
3 feet wide across the cope and base. The opening, which is checked<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span></p>

the top of the ambry and in the hollow of the roof or cope the
Annunciation is sculptured. The Blessed Virgin stands on one side and
the angel on the other, holding the scroll with the salutation. Between
them is the pot of lilies, and behind the Virgin an open book,
symbolising the prophecies regarding her.</p>

<p>Above the ambry are seen indications of broken work, as if there had
been something more sculptured above, and in the village, built into one
of the cottages, there is a series of figures (Fig. <a href="#fig_1115">1115</a>), which have
clearly been taken from the church, and which possibly stood over this
ambry. These carvings are just the length required to fit the space, the
panel containing them being 3 feet 1½ inch wide. Mr. Robertson, however,
thinks that these figures formed part of a tomb, and that the broken
remains on the top of the ambry indicate the former existence of some
kind of parapet; but in any view, to bring these figures back to the
church would be a fitting conclusion to the admirable work which has
lately been carried out by the minister, the Rev. Dr. Burr, with the
assistance of Mr. T. S. Robertson, architect.</p>

<p>The alterations lately effected consisted in removing a partition wall,
which, along with the rood screen, separated the east end of the
building from the part used as the Parish Church, and in removing the
plaster ceiling, which cut across the tracery of the west window,
preparatory to putting on a new open timber roof. The belfry replaces a
nondescript erection of last century. The bell (Fig. <a href="#fig_1116">1116</a>), which is
old, is 14 inches high by 17¼ inches in diameter at the lip, and is
attached to the stock by three canons. The stock is of oak, and,
although bound with iron, is much rent. The bell is very heavy and of
simple but beautiful form. The letters of the inscription seem to have
been formed separately, and fitted round the mould in which the bell was
cast.</p>

<p>The font (Fig. <a href="#fig_1117">1117</a>) is richly sculptured, but is much mutilated. It is
octagonal in shape, and measures 3 feet high, with a round basin, 20½
inches wide. In the panels round the basin are sculptured scenes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span></p>

<p>The College of St. Salvator was founded and endowed by Bishop Kennedy,

for his liberality to the Church. He also founded and endowed a

<p>St. Andrews, and the other buildings of which are modern. The church
bears the marks of the period when it was erected, the latter half of
the fifteenth century. It consists (Fig. <a href="#fig_1121">1121</a>) of a single oblong
chamber about 107 feet long and 28 feet wide internally, with a
three-sided apse at the east end. There are now no windows in the north
and west walls, but the south wall is divided by buttresses into seven
bays, with a large pointed window in each, which, together with the
three windows of the eastern apse, sufficiently light the church. The
central window of the apse is larger than the others. The tracery in the
windows is modern. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span> buttresses between the bays are bold and
effective (Fig. <a href="#fig_1122">1122</a>), having a broad moulded base and being enriched
with canopied niches for statues on their face. The canopies on the
buttresses next the apse are placed</p>

<p class="nind">window (Fig. <a href="#fig_1123">1123</a>), the buttresses being slightly extended beyond the
others to receive it. The porch is roofed with groined vaulting, and has
a stone bench on each side, and a canopied niche on each side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">{203}</a></span>
wide entrance arch. A shield at the apex bore the arms and mitre of
Bishop Kennedy. The doorway within the porch has a three-sided head or
arch, and the north door opposite it has a similar top.</p>

<p>The tower at the south-west angle of the church is of the usual plain
unbuttressed form (Fig. <a href="#fig_1124">1124</a>) common at the period in Scotland. On the
ground floor it contains the gateway to the college. Over the outer
archway are the arms of Bishop Kennedy in a cusped panel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1125">1125</a>),
having a canopied niche on each side. Over this the tower rises to the
string course under the belfry story, with no features but small loops
in the wall. The belfry story has a lofty double window on each of its
four sides.</p>

</div>

<p>These windows are pointed and cusped, and a broad cusped transome
divides them in their height. The angles of this story are splayed, and
it is finished with a new plain parapet resting on a simple corbel
course. The tower is surmounted by an octagonal spire of the stunted
kind common at this time, and with a very marked entasis. It is divided
by two string courses in the height, and has two tiers of lucarnes.</p>

<p>In the interior of the north wall, close to the apse, stand the remains
of the splendid monument erected by Bishop Kennedy (Fig. <a href="#fig_1126">1126</a>). It forms
in appearance the interior of an apse with five sides, elaborately
carved with minute niches and recesses, and is covered with vaulting
(now broken). This apse is spanned by a moulded and pointed arch carried
on clustered shafts. Beside these, and over the arch, there is a
succession of niches and figures, interspersed with tall much subdivided
windows. Unfortunately this monument was greatly damaged by the fall of
the roof, which occurred last century. According to tradition six
splendid silver maces were found within the tomb, one of which is
preserved in the college, and the others were distributed amongst the
other Scottish universities. But it has been shown by Mr. Alex. J. S.
Brooke, F.S.A. Scot., in a paper read before the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland (see <i>Proceedings</i>, 1892, in which these and other Scottish
maces are fully illustrated), that this tradition is erroneous, and that
the maces of Glasgow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">{204}</a></span></p>

<p>Aberdeen, and Edinburgh Universities are of different dates, and were
made expressly for these universities. The three maces belonging to St.
Andrews are:&mdash;1, The mace of the Faculty of Arts; 2, the mace of the
Faculty of Canon Law, now the Theological Faculty; and 3, the mace of
St. Salvator’s College&mdash;all of St. Andrews. No. 1 has a beautiful knop
or head of tabernacle work, in three stages. It probably dates from
early in the fifteenth century, and is of French workmanship. No. 2 is
of a somewhat similar design, but is probably of Scottish manufacture.
No. 3 is the most beautiful of the three St. Andrews maces. It bears the
arms and initials of Bishop Kennedy, and the knop is of elaborate
tabernacle work, containing allegorical and other figures. The style of
workmanship of the mace of St. Leonard’s, which is still preserved at
the College, corresponds with that of the tomb. The inscription on the
mace states that it was made in Paris, by John Maiel, in the year 1461.
It seems not improbable that the tomb was also designed in France. To
the right of the monument there is a very effectively designed sacrament
house, having the royal arms, and those of Bishop Kennedy above it. The
shield of the latter, with his mitre, is also seen to the left of the
monument. This sacrament house is somewhat earlier in date than several
others given below, and is of superior design. In this case the pyx,
supported by two angels, is carved on the corbel beneath. Shafts, with
cap and base on each side of the ambry, support a pointed arch above,
ornamented with crockets and finial. A crocketed pinnacle encloses the
composition on each side. The whole design is good and is well carried
out.</p>

<p>The town of Dalkeith stands between the rivers North and South Esk,
about six miles south from Edinburgh. A church dedicated to St. Nicholas
existed here from an early period. It was raised into a collegiate
church in the fifteenth century, and since the Reformation has been the
church of the parish.</p>

<p>This church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1127">1127</a>) consults of a nave of three bays with aisles,
and a western tower, north and south transepts, and an aisleless choir
of three bays, with an eastern apse. The western part of the church and
a portion of the choir extending as far as the south doorway (at which
point a wall has been erected across the building, as indicated by
dotted lines) are used as the Parish Church. About 1854 this church
underwent a thorough restoration. Much of the interest attached to it as
an ancient building was thus effaced, but the original plan has not been
greatly altered. The appearance of the building before the above date is
shown by Fig. <a href="#fig_1128">1128</a>, which is reproduced from a drawing in the Hutton
Collection in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">{206}</a></span> Advocates’ Library.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The steeple shown in this

old steeple of Glasgow College,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and is much more likely to have been
built, as the latter was, in the seventeenth century than in the
eighteenth. The tower was probably repaired at the latter date, when, as
we are informed, the church itself was so treated. The walls of the
tower, where they have been left unrestored, and the staircase turret
adjoining are undoubtedly older than the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The eastern portion of the choir (Fig. <a href="#fig_1129">1129</a>) has stood for centuries in
a roofless and ruinous condition. It has originally been vaulted,
probably with a pointed barrel vault supporting a stone roof. As much</p>

apse have been partially built up (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1129">1129</a>). The apse windows are
built at the same level as the other windows, thus leaving a great

the arches of the windows to be kept below the springing of the main
vault, as may be observed at Ladykirk, Seton Church, and elsewhere. In
the churches of Linlithgow and Stirling the central window of the apse
is larger than the others, but in those cases the vaulting is different,
and allows greater height for the windows. The parapet above the walls
of the choir is plain and rests on a string course, which has been
carved with foliage. The doorway in the south side (Fig. <a href="#fig_1131">1131</a>) is round
arched, and in the freedom of the treatment of its details very much
resembles what is found in the neighbouring Church of Rosslyn.</p>

<p>The buttresses (Fig. <a href="#fig_1132">1132</a>), like those of Rosslyn, are massive, and
although they have five or six stages, they do not recede at these
stages till the wall head is nearly reached, where they are finished
with a gablet beneath which a large gargoyle is projected. The
buttresses were crowned with square pinnacles, finished with crockets
and finials, only two of which now remain, in a very ruinous state. They
have been carefully wrought on the inside, so as to adjust themselves to
the sloping flanks of the stone roof, the water from which was conveyed
through the buttresses by the projecting gargoyles to the ground. There
is a canopied niche on the face of all the buttresses, as well as those

Earl of Morton in 1457, and his wife Johan, third daughter of King James
I. The former died about 1498. Mr. Drummond supposes the lady survived

1490.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The facts on which that view is founded are the presence of

<p>The monument is in a very dilapidated condition, the base and lower half
of the pedestal being buried in earth and rubbish, the accumulation of
centuries. The arms on the pedestal (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1133">1133</a>) are the same as
those already referred to as carved at the heads of the figures. They
are repeated on the opposite side of the pedestal, but in inverse order.
The canopied work along the top of the pedestal is similar to what is
seen surmounting a fragment of royal arms at Dunfermline (see Fig. 218),
which fragment may also have been part of a tomb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">{213}</a></span></p>

<p>The precise date of the founding of the Chapel of St. Nicholas does not
appear to be known, but since 1372, when Robert II. granted a licence to
James of Douglas to endow a chaplainry therein, frequent notices of it
appear.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>This church is situated near the well known castle of the same name in
the south-east part of the county, and about nine miles from Edinburgh.
With the exception of the south aisle or chapel, the church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1136">1136</a>)
was entirely rebuilt about forty years ago.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> To judge from what of
the old plan can now be made out, the structure has originally been a
Norman one, with aisleless nave and choir, and a circular eastern apse.
The reconstruction of the edifice included that of the apse and the
south wall of the chancel, which, although not entirely new, are yet
practically so, none of the ancient architectural features being left,
but only, at most, some of the walling. The apse is about 16 feet wide
by about 10 feet 6 inches deep, and was lighted by three narrow widely
splayed windows. The chancel was about 16 feet 6 inches long by 22 feet
wide. The south wall contained two windows, and apparently a piscina,
but all these features have disappeared, as well as the more important
arches which formed the entrance to the chancel and the apse.</p>

<p>A south aisle or chapel (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1136">1136</a>) has been added to the church. It
is entire and is a good example of Scottish Gothic of the latter half of
the fifteenth century, having in all probability been built about the
same<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span> time as the castle, the licence for the erection of which is dated
1430. William de Borthwick, a man of some eminence, was created Lord
Borthwick shortly before that date, and the aisle is believed to have
been erected by him. This aisle is vaulted with a pointed barrel vault,

have been entirely coloured, and considerable traces of the colour still
remain. The length of the arched recess in which the figures lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span> is 7
feet, and the depth of the recess 3 feet 8½ inches. The height to the
arched recess is about 3 feet 6½ inches, and the total height of the
monument is 10 feet 3 inches, and the width over the buttresses 8 feet
11 inches. The design is of a usual form, and the enrichments indicate a
late date in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The Church of Borthwick was annexed by Chancellor Crichton to his newly
erected College of Crichton. After the Reformation Borthwick was united
to Heriot and Stow, and served by a reader, but in 1596 James VI.
erected it into a separate parish. In 1606 the kirk-session complained
that the church was falling into ruin for want of proper repair.
Commissioners from the Presbytery met the complainers, and after
deliberation they refused to “stent” themselves for the repair of the
church, but offered instead to sell the vestry (see Plan) “as a family
burial-place to any gentleman who would pay such a price as would enable
them to repair the choir.”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> An offer of the building was made to Sir
James Dundas of Arniston, who ultimately purchased it, and with the
money thus raised the church appears to have been repaired in a rough
fashion. The chancel arch was built up and a gable wall erected above
it, which thus became the east end of the church, and the apse was left
outside. A gallery was then placed against the east gable. The structure
remained in this condition till 1780, when it was destroyed by fire. The
walls which survived the fire are those shown on the Plan (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1136">1136</a>). The vestry (now the Dundas burial vault) and south aisle, both
having stone roofs, remain comparatively unscathed. The nave and the
north wall of the chancel have entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>This very complete and almost unaltered church stands on the high north
bank of the river Tweed, nearly opposite Norham Castle. Before the
Reformation the parish consisted of the two parishes of Upsetlington and
Horndene. In 1296 the parson of the former swore fealty to Edward I.,
who, while endeavouring to arrange regarding the succession to the crown
of Scotland, adjourned the Scottish Parliament from Brigham in England
to an open field in Upsetlington. The existing church is said to have
been built in 1500, and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin by James IV., in
gratitude for his delivery from being drowned by a sudden flood of the
river Tweed.</p>

<p>The structure (Fig. <a href="#fig_1140">1140</a>) is a specially characteristic example of the
Scottish church architecture of the period. It is a triapsidal cross
church, without aisles, having an apsidal termination at the east end of
the chancel and at the north and south ends of the transept. The body
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span> the church and the transepts are covered with pointed barrel vaults,
with ribs at intervals, springing from small corbels (Fig. <a href="#fig_1141">1141</a>); and
the whole is roofed with overlapping stone flags (Fig. <a href="#fig_1142">1142</a>). The nave
and chancel are 94 feet 6 inches in length by 23 feet 3 inches in width
internally, and the transepts, which are very short, each measures 12
feet in depth from north to south by 19 feet in width. The side windows
are of considerable width, but being entirely below the springing of the
vault, they are low compared with the height of the church. The side
walls rise greatly above the windows on the exterior, and have a heavy
appearance, while the lofty vaults of the interior render the building
dark. The arches</p>

<p class="nind">which open from the main church into the transepts (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1141">1141</a>) are
also kept below the springing of the main vault, and are therefore low,
but the windows in the transepts are kept well up. To resist the
pressure of the heavy vaults and roof the walls are well buttressed, and
the buttresses terminate with the somewhat stunted pinnacles in vogue at
the time. It will be noticed that the overlapping stone roofs are
constructed in three distinct portions, viz., one roof extending over
the whole of the nave and chancel, and two separate roofs over each
transept. The roofs and vaults of each of the transepts terminate
against a gable raised on the side walls of the main part of the church,
and the transepts are entered by low arches, on which these gables
rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span></p>

<p>Both the interior and exterior of the church are quite plain, especially
the former, in which there is no attempt at ornament of any kind. As
regards the exterior, the buttresses with their pinnacles, and the
windows with their simple tracery, give a pleasing effect, especially as
seen from the east (Fig. <a href="#fig_1143">1143</a>).</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the exterior is the elliptic form
of the arches over the side windows of the nave and choir (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1142">1142</a>). This peculiar form has evidently resulted from the desire to make
these windows as wide as possible, so as to admit light. But as all the
window</p>

interior is but imperfectly lighted. There are three doorways in the
building&mdash;the south-west door in the nave, the priest’s door in the
chancel, and a door in the south transept. These are all semicircular in
the arch-head, as is common in Scottish examples. That in the south
transept is now built up.</p>

<p>The tower at the west end is 14 feet square externally. The lower part
is of the same date as the church, and has the base courses returning
round it. The upper part has been rebuilt. The doorway to the tower is

<h2><a name="SETON_COLLEGIATE_CHURCH_Haddingtonshire" id="SETON_COLLEGIATE_CHURCH_Haddingtonshire"></a>SETON COLLEGIATE CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Haddingtonshire</span>.</h2>

<p>A disused edifice situated in the private grounds of Seton Castle, about
two miles east from Prestonpans Railway Station. The parish of Seton
having been joined to that of Tranent in 1580, service in the church has
from that time been abandoned.</p>

<p>There was a church here from an early date. It is rated in the ancient
Taxatio at 18 merks. In a MS. pedigree of the family of Seton, by
Maitland of Lethington, quoted by Grose,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> it is stated that Sir
Alex. Seton, in the time of David <small>II.</small>, was buried in the Parish Church
of Seton. Also that Katherine Sinclair, wife of William, first Lord
Seton, about 1390, “Biggit ane yle on the south side of the Paroch Kirk
of Seton of fine estlar, pendit and theikit it with stane, with ane
sepulchar thairin quhair she lies.” Her son John (died 1441) was buried
in this aisle.</p>

<p>George, the second Lord Seton, in 1493, made the church collegiate. He
built the sacristy and covered it with stone in the reign of James IV.
He died in 1507, and was buried near the high altar.</p>

<p>George, the third Lord Seton, who was slain at Flodden, “Theickit the
Queir of Seton with stane.” Jane Hepburne, his widow, after his decease,
“Biggit the forewark of Seton above the zit, and also she biggit the
northomoss yll of the College Kirk of Seton and took down the yll biggit
be Dame Katherine Sinclair on the south side of it, the said college
kirk, because the syde of it stood to the syde of the kirk, to mack it a
parfecte and a proper cornet and a cross kirk and biggit up the steeple
as ye see it now to ane grit hight swa that it wants little of
compleiting.” This lady also presented the church with many ornaments of
silver and rich vestments.</p>

<p>From the above quotations it would appear that the parish church existed
in the fourteenth century. This church was probably rebuilt towards the
end of the fifteenth century, and was added to by the second Lord Seton
when he made the church collegiate in 1493, and completed by the third
Lord Seton. The transepts and tower and spire would appear to have been
erected by the Dowager Lady Seton in the sixteenth century, after her
husband’s death at the Battle of Flodden.</p>

<p>The collegiate foundation consisted of a provost, six prebendaries, one
clerk, and two singing boys. The edifice has undoubtedly been rebuilt or
restored at the date of its being made collegiate. It corresponds in
style with the numerous collegiate foundations established in the

<p>The stone roof of the choir was removed at some period. The masonry,
however, survived, and the edifice has now been roofed in and properly
defended from the weather by the late Lord Wemyss, who, along with his
Countess, is buried in the choir. The broken tracery of the windows has
been renewed by the present Lord Wemyss. The church was designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">{225}</a></span></p>

east end), a north sacristy, a north and south transept, and a central
tower and spire over the crossing. The choir is 53 feet in length by 22
feet in width internally. The exterior (Fig. <a href="#fig_1145">1145</a>) is divided into three
bays, separated by buttresses. There is a round-headed doorway in the
central bay of the south wall, with a panel containing a coat of arms in
the upper part of the wall, and mullioned windows in the other bays
(including the apse), except that in the north wall at the part where
the sacristy is built. The arched heads are all filled with tracery of a
simple character and of</p>

substantial form, and each is crowned with a square, but rather stunted,
pinnacle, the enriched pyramidal tops of nearly all of them being

buttress to receive a statue, but they are now all empty. Fig. <a href="#fig_1146">1146</a>

<p>The interior of the choir (Fig. <a href="#fig_1147">1147</a>) is extremely simple. It is roofed
with a pointed barrel vault, the surface of which, towards the east end,
is ornamented with moulded ribs. These ribs spring from corbels in each

centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227" id="page_227">{227}</a></span> of the choir, where they cease, leaving the remainder of the

them in the north wall a monument (Fig. <a href="#fig_1149">1149</a>) under the north-east

is opposite that in the south wall. The sacristy is about 14 feet by 12
feet. It has a plain barrel vault, which supports an upper story, of
which the window is visible (Fig. <a href="#fig_1150">1150</a>), but there is no apparent means
of access to it. The building has a roof of overlapping stone flags. The
sacristy has one small eastern window, with a piscina near it, and a
fireplace. In the angle next the apse there is a squint commanding a
view of the altar.</p>

<p>The tower is 25 feet square. On the ground level there are arched
openings 9 feet 6 inches wide (Fig. <a href="#fig_1151">1151</a>) towards the choir and each
transept, and also in the west wall towards the intended nave, the
latter being built up. The stair turret is placed at the south-east
angle, and partly projects into the south transept (Fig. <a href="#fig_1152">1152</a>). It is
also visible on the exterior (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1145">1145</a>). The tower is carried up
over the crossing one story in height above the roof, and is crowned
with a broach-spire, the top of which is unfinished. This is one of the
very few examples of broach-spires in Scotland. The ground floor over
the crossing is groin vaulted, and has a circular opening in the centre.</p>

<p>The transepts are each about 27 feet long by 18 feet wide, and each is
divided into two bays, with buttresses, pinnacles, and traceried
windows, similar to those of the choir. These traceries were all much
damaged, but they have been repaired by Lord Wemyss. The vaulting (see

<p>This church, which is dedicated to St. Ternan, is situated about three
or four miles from Bervie, and not far from the old mansion of
Arbuthnott. It is an exceedingly interesting and picturesque structure,
and contains work of three distinct periods, representing different
phases of Scottish ecclesiastical architecture. There is first the
chancel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1156">1156</a>), dedicated by Bishop Bernham in 1242, and possibly
the nave may also be in part of the same period. Then there is the very
striking south wing or aisle, which is known, from the Arbuthnott
Missal, to have been built by Sir Robert Arbuthnott in the end of the
fifteenth century. This aisle (Fig. <a href="#fig_1157">1157</a>), which is two stories in
height, is a remarkable example of the style with which we are familiar
in the collegiate and other churches of the period. In the third place,
the quaint west end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1158">1158</a>) represents an example of the application
to an ecclesiastical structure of features of the domestic architecture
of the country, of which there are so many examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span> throughout
Scotland. In February 1889 “the nave, then the only part in use, was
burned, and the fire destroyed a partition which cut off the chancel.”
None of the structural features of the church suffered any damage, and
the chancel and the south aisle, having little or nothing in their
construction of a combustible nature, escaped altogether. The church has
been well restored by Mr. A. M. Mackenzie, architect, Aberdeen,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> a
new roof having been placed on the nave and chancel, and suitable new
fittings and furniture introduced. The three windows in the east wall of
the chancel have been renewed, exactly after the remains of the original
ones.</p>

</div>

<p>The nave, which measures internally about 60 feet 6 inches long by 18
feet wide, has a north and south round-arched doorway, with a bead
moulding on the angles. These doorways are, perhaps, of the sixteenth
century. The three windows on the south side have centre mullions, and
are finished with straight lintels (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1157">1157</a>); and, although
renewed, they represent the original arrangement. Besides these there
are two small windows in the west gable (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1158">1158</a>). A stoup in the
wall inside adjoins the south door.</p>

<p>The chancel arch is about 12 feet wide by 13 feet high. It has a double
splay on each side, and is acutely pointed. The chancel is about 26 feet
5 inches long by 15 feet 6 inches wide. The total internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span> length of
the church is 90 feet. There is a small north doorway in the chancel,
which was evidently not meant to lead to the outside, but to a</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">sacristy or some such apartment; and projecting tusk stones in the
corner outside the door show that such a building was contemplated. The
chancel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1159">1159</a>) is lighted by small widely splayed windows on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span>
side, and three lintelled windows in the east end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1160">1160</a>). Mr.
Mackenzie shows reasons for believing that this gable has been
reconstructed, and that it originally had only two windows in the lower
part, with perhaps some kind of central window at a higher level,
something like what is found at Mortlach. The pointed piscina (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1161">1161</a>) beneath the eastmost south window (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1160">1160</a>) has, as usual,
been mutilated.</p>

</div>

<p>To connect the chancel with the Arbuthnott Aisle a round archway (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_1160">1160</a>), 7 feet 8 inches wide, has been cut through the chancel wall.
The details of this arch are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1162">1162</a>. This chapel or aisle,
which has an apsidal south end, measures about 20 feet 3 inches long by
12 feet 11 inches wide, and has a vaulted stone roof (Fig. <a href="#fig_1163">1163</a>) about
18 feet high, with a semi-octagonal dome over the apse. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239">{239}</a></span> view gives
an idea of the appearance of the interior of the chapel. In front of the
apse windows stands a sarcophagus 6 feet 2 inches long by 2 feet 2
inches wide, having a rude recumbent figure on the top. It contains the
following arms on the front, beginning at the head, viz., Douglas,
Arbuthnott, Arbuthnott, Stewart; and there appear to be indications that
there have been other shields, now cut away. There is a round arched
entrance door to the aisle on the west side (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1157">1157</a>), with a
stoup beneath the adjoining window on the inside, and in the east wall
are the remains of a credence. A turret staircase</p>

length.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> It had a strong door, which folded back into a recess. The
room is of the same size and shape as the aisle below, and is lighted
with three windows with square heads, two in the apse, and one (the
largest) looking towards the west (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1157">1157</a>). The latter is
strongly guarded with an iron grating of the usual construction. The
windows are fitted with seats like those commonly found in the castles.

<p>The Arbuthnott Missal, already referred to, with its two companion
volumes the Psalter and Office of the Blessed Virgin, have been well

the use of this church by the vicar, James Sybbald. The Missal was

three volumes was probably written a short time before the Psalter.</p>

<p>From the Register of the Great Seal of date 30th May 1505, it appears

<p>This edifice stands on the south side of the valley where the river Tyne
takes its rise, about four miles from Tynehead Railway Station. It is
seen from the railway, together with Crichton Castle, from which it is
only about a quarter of a mile distant.</p>

<p>The building is still in use as the parish church. It consists (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1165">1165</a>) of a chancel, measuring internally about 44 feet from east to west
by about 24 feet 10 inches in width, a central tower about 24 feet
square,</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">and north and south transepts, the total length of which, from north to
south, is about 70 feet. The north wall of the nave is erected for a
length of about 16 feet, but of the south wall only a few feet have been
built.</p>

<p>To adapt the edifice to the Presbyterian system of worship, probably the
very worst plan which could have been devised has been adopted, and is
shown on the Plan by clear lines. The original fabric may be said to
remain, but it is greatly deformed. As the tower opened into the unbuilt
nave it had necessarily to be walled up, and has an entrance doorway
left in the centre. This doorway, which is round arched, seems to be
old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244">{244}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">and was probably brought from a building which appears to have formerly
stood on the north side of the church. Across the interior of the tower
a stone wall has been built to enclose the modern church. The portion of
the tower outside this wall thus forms a vestibule, from which a stair</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">leads to a west gallery fitted up in the enclosed portion of the tower.
Another door has been slapped through the east wall to the outside, and
an outer stair at the east end leads to an inserted gallery running
across that end. One window and a sacristy or similar building on the
north<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span> side have been done away with, to allow the erection of a passage
for reaching another gallery, which runs along the north side of the
chancel. The north transept has, perhaps, been worst used of all. A wall
has been built between the moulded responds to a height of about 5 feet,
and the whole area of the transept at this level is roofed over to form
a burial vault. The south transept is not utilised in any way except as
a sort of lumber place.</p>

<p>Instead of this unsuitable and costly arrangement, the area of the
church as it stood would suffice to give more accommodation than is thus
obtained, and that without sacrificing the dignity of the building, as
has been done by the arrangements just described.</p>

<p>It would appear from a letter by the Rev. John Gourlay, the parish
minister, to General Hutton, dated Crichton, 4th April 1789, that the</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1168" style="width: 385px;">

</div>

<p class="nind">tower, with probably the transepts, then sufficed for the congregation.
He says, “There is a high building upon the one end where the bell
hangs, and where divine service was lately performed, but since
considerable reparations were given, it is now again altered to what is
called the quire.”</p>

<p>The original entrance to the church was on the south side of the chancel
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_1165">1165</a>). It has been partly destroyed and is now built up, but
portions of its moulded jambs can still be seen. The mouldings are of a
common kind, consisting of two beads separated by a hollow. The doorway
has been 3 feet 10 inches wide. Above the doorway a window has been
roughly hacked through the wall, and on the inside of the sill there are
rudely carved the initials P. L., with the date 1729. These are probably
the initials of the worthy who contrived certain of the alterations<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247">{247}</a></span>
above described. At the same time two small windows have been knocked
through the side walls beneath the original windows on the north and
south sides nearest the east end. One of these is shown in the view Fig.
<a href="#fig_1166">1166</a>, and the other on the north side is shown on the Plan. These
windows have been referred to by Mr. Muir and in the Architectural
Publication Societies Dictionary as examples of lychnoscope or offertory
windows; but undoubtedly they were inserted to give light beneath the
east gallery, and are of no older date than last century. Only one of
the original windows, that on the north side, retains the original
tracery (Fig. <a href="#fig_1167">1167</a>). Indications of the tracery of the transept windows
also still remain. The choir has been divided into three bays by
buttresses, which have the numerous set-offs of the period, and are
finished with the ordinary late pinnacles. The high blank wall over the
windows, which generally</p>

<p class="nind">accompanies the pointed barrel vaults, has been in this case lightened
by the introduction of a false parapet (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1166">1166</a>), with enrichments
of square shaped flowers, both in the main cornice and in the upper
cornice, which represents the cope of the parapet. But here there is no
parapet wall, the eaves of the roof being placed where the parapet cope
would be in ordinary circumstances. This is a plan often adopted in
domestic buildings, from which the idea was, no doubt, borrowed in this
instance. The transepts are without buttresses and have a bare
appearance. Adjoining the south entrance doorway there are what appear
to be the remains of a sedilia (Fig. <a href="#fig_1168">1168</a>). The lower portion is
entirely concealed, and the eastern shaft and recess are almost blocked.
In the north wall opposite the original entrance there can be seen on
the inside the indications of a round arched doorway, now built up,
which probably led to the sacristy or a chapel, now destroyed, as
already mentioned. Five feet east from this blocked doorway there are
slight remains of a sixteenth or seventeenth century monument (see
Plan), now cut away to permit of the erection of the gallery over, and
it seems probable that from this monument was taken the coat of arms
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1169">1169</a>) now built into the wall which closes up the west archway of
the tower. The shield bears the Nicolson arms, and are probably those of
Agnes Nicolson, third wife of Patrick, first Lord Elibank, who possessed
the ecclesiastical lands of the Collegiate Church of Crichton about the
beginning of the seventeenth century. Mr. Billings shows another coat of
arms on the outside of the turret stair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span> but this part of the building
is now a dense mass of ivy. The turret stair is in the north wall of the
nave, and is placed at some distance from the tower. Fig. <a href="#fig_1170">1170</a> shows the
piscina in the south transept. Across this</p>

<p class="nind">transept, where shown on the Plan, there is a wooden screen (Fig. <a href="#fig_1171">1171</a>)
of late erection, but not without some character, near its centre, and
beneath the south arch of the tower there stands up, a few inches from
the pavement, a broken worn stone about 12 inches square, the purpose of
which is not obvious.</p>

<p>The church throughout is vaulted with a pointed barrel vault, but no
provision has been made for the vaulting of the nave. Crichton Church
was converted, in 1449, by Sir William Crichton, well known as
Chancellor Crichton, into a collegiate establishment for a provost, nine
prebendaries, and two singing boys, and was suitably endowed. The
existing structure was probably erected at that time. Sir William also
built an extensive addition to the Castle of Crichton, and doubtless the
same builders were employed on church and castle, as many of the details
closely resemble each other. From Mr. Gourlay’s letter, already referred
to, it appears that there was a provost’s house about a mile distant. He
mentions that it was then used as a farmhouse and called Rosehall, and
that there was a place of worship beside it and a churchyard, but with
the exception of the latter nothing now remains.</p>

<p>The tower is supported by pointed arches springing from responds in the
four sides. The responds are of simple section, and the caps contain
some good late foliaged carving (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1171">1171</a>).</p>

<p>The walls are carried up with one low story above the set-off<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_249" id="page_249">{249}</a></span></p>

contains, in each face, a two-light window with square lintel and
central mullion. The story is surmounted by a plain parapet, supported
by a corbel course, and the tower is finished with a gabled roof, having
a simple belfry on the apex of the east gable.</p>

acquired by Adam Forrester, a burgess and provost of Edinburgh, in the
year 1376, and the title of Lord Forrester of Corstorphine continued in
the family till the year 1763.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_251" id="page_251">{251}</a></span></p>

<p>There was a chapel at Corstorphine as early as the year 1128, which was
granted to the new Abbey of Holyrood. This structure afterwards became
the parish church, and continued to be so after the erection of the
collegiate church, which still exists. Of this original chapel no trace
now remains. It stood on the north side of the present building, on part
of the ground now occupied by the existing north transept. This
transept, which was built in the present century, is not the immediate
successor of the old parish church, but takes the place of an aisle
which was built in 1646, the erection of which caused the removal of
what remained of the old parish church.</p>

<p>The existing church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1172">1172</a>) consists of a chancel, a nave with north
and south transepts situated at its west end, a western tower and spire,
and a sacristy on the north side of the chancel. The whole building is
small in size and of low proportions, the height of the tower and spire</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">being only 50 feet, but although somewhat debased in style, it is very
quaint and picturesque.</p>

<p>The structure suffered great alteration and damage from a restoration
which took place about the beginning of this century. At that time the
north transept, together with the seventeenth century aisle, above
mentioned, and a part of the nave were taken down.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> A new north
transept was built, and a new additional nave was erected on the north
side of the old nave. A doorway was knocked through the east wall of the
chancel, which necessitated the shortening of the large east window
above it by raising the sill. At the same time, the chancel was
converted into a lumber chamber and porch, by the process of building up
the chancel arch. As regards the sacristy, its floor has been dug out to
a depth of about 7 feet, and it is now used as a heating chamber and
coal cellar.</p>

<p>During this restoration a quantity of carved and moulded stones was
removed from the church to Juniper Green, in the vicinity, where
probably about fifty fragments, several containing the Forrester arms,
were built into a wall on the road leading from the above village to
Baberton House, but the wall has since been removed. Fig. <a href="#fig_1173">1173</a> is a
sketch of one of these stones, bearing three hunting horns impaling a
bend engrailed. At Hermiston House, also, several carved blocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_252" id="page_252">{252}</a></span></p>

<p>The plan of the building (omitting the alterations above described) is
remarkable. It seems to consist of two portions&mdash;(1) the transepts and
division to the east of them, forming one church, and (2) the choir

<p>In the east wall of the chancel a stone is fixed, with an inscription in
memory of the first provost of the college, the stone being “apparently
transferred,” says Mr. Laing, “from the place where the provost was
buried.” The inscription is in the following terms, viz.:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254">{254}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>This inscription clearly fixes the date of the commencement of the
collegiate church, but although it has been transferred to the chancel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">{255}</a></span>
there is nothing to show that the collegiate church it refers to is the
chancel. It is quite as likely to have reference to the church to the
west of the chancel, from which it was probably removed to its present
position. Both from the arrangement of the Plan and the aspect of the
eastern part of the building generally, it presents a distinct
individuality. It is both</p>

<p class="nind">higher and wider than the church to the west, and suggests the idea of
having been built at a different time. Now it is matter of history that
Adam Forrester, already mentioned, who died in 1405, built a chapel
dedicated to St. John the Baptist adjoining the parish church, and it is
not unlikely that this chancel was that chapel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span></p>

<p>In 1425-6 a charter was granted by King James I. for the endowment of
three chaplainries in the chapel contiguous to the Parish Church of
Corstorphine,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and securing to it, amongst other things, the annual
rents in Edinburgh bestowed by the late Sir Adam Forrester. That charter
clearly shows that this chapel, wherever situated, was in existence
before</p>

<p class="nind">the year mentioned in Provost Bannatyne’s inscription. Further, in the
Chamberlain Rolls of 1434,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> reference is made to the three chaplains
of the Chapel of St. John the Baptist&mdash;“contiguous to the Parish Church
of Corstorphine,” showing the independent existence of that chapel after
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_257" id="page_257">{257}</a></span> date in the Bannatyne inscription. It seems, therefore, most
probable that this was the chapel erected by Sir Adam Forrester.</p>

<p>Sir Adam was succeeded by his son Sir John Forrester, who filled the
office of Great Chamberlain of Scotland, and on the return of James <small>I.</small>
from England was appointed Master of the Household in 1424. The</p>

<p class="nind">collegiate church was founded and endowed by Sir John. Although the
inscription to Bannatyne, the first provost, says that it was begun in
1429, the foundation was only completed by a Papal Bull in 1444, at
which date Sir John was probably living. The foundation consisted of a
provost, four prebendaries, and two singing boys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">{258}</a></span></p>

<p>From the above records, and also from the style of the architecture,
there can scarcely be a doubt but that the church to the west was the
collegiate church erected after 1444, and in designing it, the plan was
so arranged as to incorporate the older Chapel of St. John the Baptist
as the chancel of the new church. It is remarkable that, although the
chancel</p>

supposed founder of it. It may, however, be mentioned that Mr. Laing
believes that an inscription on a stone, which has been built out of its
proper place, in the small porch to the west of the tower, has been
taken from a monument to Sir Adam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">{259}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">east window of three lights (Fig. <a href="#fig_1174">1174</a>), having perpendicular tracery,
the lower part of which has been altered, as above pointed out.</p>

<p>There are two small windows in the south side of the chancel, and
between them, in the interior, is a fine sedilia, somewhat mutilated
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1175">1175</a>). Beside it is a piscina (Fig. <a href="#fig_1176">1176</a>), with the basin, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_261" id="page_261">{261}</a></span>
usually happens, cut away. In the niche of the piscina there is a stone
shelf used as a credence table, and over the niche a projecting round
canopy. A very similar canopy exists over the upper small niche on the
exterior of the east gable.</p>

<p>In the north wall of the chancel are two recessed tombs (Figs. <a href="#fig_1177">1177</a> and
<a href="#fig_1178">1178</a>). These monuments, judging from the disturbed appearance of the
surrounding masonry and from the different character of the two designs,
were apparently not original parts of the chapel, but were subsequently
inserted as the occasion arose. The arch stones of the westmost tomb
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_1177">1177</a>), that of Sir John Forrester (the eldest son of Sir Adam)
and his wife, are cut away or concealed by the west wall of the chapel,
an arrangement not likely to have been adopted had the tomb been erected
when the chapel was built. This monument is usually called the Founder’s
Tomb, from the circumstance that Sir John founded the collegiate church.
He was twice married: first, to Jean Sinclair, daughter of Henry, first
Earl of Orkney; and, second, to Dame Marion Stewart, Lady Dalswinton,
widow of Sir John Stewart.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> His effigy rests on the tomb, along with
that of one of his wives. Sir John died after the year 1444.</p>

<p>The eastmost tomb (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1178">1178</a>) is that of the son of the foregoing,
also Sir John, who died before 1454. It contains his effigy and that of
his wife. It does not appear to be known to what family the lady
belonged; but from the heraldic blazons (to be afterwards described) she
seems to have been a member of the Wigmer family.</p>

<p>There is another tomb situated in the south transept (Figs. <a href="#fig_1179">1179</a> and
<a href="#fig_1180">1180</a>). It is believed to be that of Sir Alexander Forrester, son of the
last mentioned Sir John. The date of his death is not recorded, but he
is known to have been alive in 1467. It contains his effigy only. There
has been a finial on the tomb, which is now gone.</p>

<p>The amount of heraldic carving on the above tombs, on the gable of the
south transept (Fig. <a href="#fig_1181">1181</a>), and on the western porch (Fig. <a href="#fig_1182">1182</a>) is
considerable and is well preserved.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

mentioned,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="c"><span class="smcap">Forrester of Corstorphine</span>, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>These shields are all reversed, so that the shield is couché the

have Forrester on the sinister instead of the dexter, and the
Wigmer arms make the bend and ribbon sinister instead of dexter.</p></div>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap">South Transept.</span></p>

<p>The shields, both on the gable outside and on the tomb inside, seem to
have been carelessly executed from an impression of the arms, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_263" id="page_263">{263}</a></span>
placing everything in the reverse way; so that what in the original is

converted into a bend sinister, and so throughout.</p>

<p>The two shields on the porch are&mdash;1st, Forrester; 2nd, Forrester
impaling Wigmer.</p>

<p>The sacristy, on the north side of the chancel, enters by a plain
lintelled door between the two tombs (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1172">1172</a>). It has a rough
pointed barrel vault, and looks, from there being windows at two levels,
as if it had contained two stories. The sill of the east window projects
about 11 inches; and Mr. Muir considers it, without doubt, to have been
an altar.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Adjoining this window is a piscina, with the orifice of
its drain wrought on the base mouldings outside.</p>

<p>As regards the architecture of the church, it accords well with the
other collegiate structures of the latter half of the fifteenth century.
The perpendicular tracery in the east window of the chancel and the
south window of the transept (see Figs. <a href="#fig_1173">1173</a> and <a href="#fig_1181">1181</a>)) is remarkable,
such tracery being very uncommon in Scotland. These two large windows
are recessed in the wall, the outer jambs having two or three broad
splays. The side windows have the tracery flush with the outer face of
the wall.</p>

<p>The buttresses have the usual numerous set-offs. They have now finials,
consisting of cubic stones carved as sundials; but, as Mr. T. S. Muir
states, these are modern additions, the buttresses having doubtless been
originally pinnacled above the eaves.</p>

<p>The tower to the west of the transept (Fig. <a href="#fig_1182">1182</a>) is one of the most
characteristic features of the structure. It measures externally about
18 feet 6 inches from north to south by 17 feet 3 inches from east to
west. The tower has a door to the church, and also a west doorway. It
thus formed an entrance porch to the building; but another porch has
been added to the west, which is vaulted and covered with a stone roof.</p>

<p>The tower is built with ashlar, and rises, without buttresses, to the
eaves. A two-light window is introduced on each face under the cornice.
Above the tower there is a stone spire of the stunted description usual
at the period. Four pinnacles give some relief to the angles at the base
of the spire. The latter is divided by battlemented string courses into
three stories, and has lucarnes in the middle story.</p>

<p>After the Reformation the collegiate church became the church of the
parish in 1593, and has so continued ever since.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_COLLEGIATE_CHURCH_OF_CRAIL_Fifeshire" id="THE_COLLEGIATE_CHURCH_OF_CRAIL_Fifeshire"></a>THE COLLEGIATE CHURCH OF CRAIL, <span class="smcap">Fifeshire</span>.</h2>

<p>The quaint old seaport of Crail lies near the eastern point of the north
side of the Frith of Forth. It is one of the earliest places in Scotland
which are known to have carried on commerce with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264" id="page_264">{264}</a></span> Continent, having
had intercourse with the Netherlands in the ninth century, where its
salt fish were sold, and the name of Crail occurs on a map of the
twelfth century.</p>

<p>There was in ancient times a royal castle at Crail, in which David I.
resided, and a number of names still exist in the locality, showing its
connection with royalty. The earliest charter of the burgh was granted
by Bruce in 1310, and confirmed by subsequent kings. It is believed that
at one time Crail was the site of a priory dedicated to St. Rufus, the
tradition of which is preserved in several local names, such as, the
prior’s croft, the prior’s walls, the nun’s peat field, and the house of
the prioress, which in 1640 was in the hands of a neighbouring
proprietor.</p>

<p>The Church of Crail belonged from an early date to the Cistercian Nuns
of Haddington. In 1177 the stipend is mentioned. This church was made
collegiate and well endowed by Sir William Myreton, vicar of Lathrick in
1509. He also established the altar of St. Michael the Archangel in
1512, and in 1514 he founded an altar to the praise and honour of God,
the Virgin Mary, and all saints, which he placed in the presentation and
donation of the bailies and community. Sir William Myreton also showed
himself a benefactor of the town by founding schools there in 1525, one
being for the teaching of grammar and the other of music. In 1515,
besides the above chaplainries, there existed in the church chaplainries
of St. James the apostle, St. Bartholomew, and St. Nicholas. An
inventory has been preserved, from which it appears that the various
altars were well furnished with plate and vestments. On account of the
foundation of the new College in the parish church, a charter was issued
by Andrew, Archbishop of St. Andrews, confirming letters by the Prioress
of Haddington, by Sir William Myreton, by the bailies and community of
Crail, and by the parishioners of the parish church, for the foundation
of a provostry with ten prebendaries, to be in the gift of the Prioress.
In 1520 another prebend was added, viz., that of St. John the Baptist.
The priory of Haddington having been erected in 1621 into a temporal
lordship in favour of John, Master of Lauderdale, the kirk lands of
Crail fell to him.</p>

<p>But in 1587 James VI. had granted a charter to the town of everything
belonging to the chaplainries, altarages, and prebends, or to the kirk
or college, except what pertained to the Abbey of Haddington. This
charter was granted on account of the prebendaries and others following
the usual course as the Reformation approached, and alienating the lands
of their benefices for their own private advantage. The old College
Church thus passed into the hands of the burgh, and was confirmed to it
in 1633 by Act of Parliament, and is still used as the parish
church.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>Although the fabric has been subjected to a considerable amount of
modern improvement, many of the original features still remain. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265">{265}</a></span>
main body of the church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1183">1183</a>) consists, as it has always done, of
an oblong main structure, divided by two rows of columns into a central
nave, and two side aisles. The nave is 63 feet long, the central
division being 27 feet 6 inches wide, and the side aisles 11 feet wide.
The central columns carry pointed arches (Fig. <a href="#fig_1184">1184</a>), and in the wall
above them was originally a small window over each column (not over the
arches as usual) with widely splayed jambs and trefoil head. The roof of
the aisles, being below the sill of these clerestory windows, was
necessarily low. This was found in recent times to be a disadvantage,
and the walls of the aisles have been rebuilt and heightened, so as to
allow the roof of the central nave to run down over them without a break
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1185">1185</a>). The old clerestory windows are thus roofed in, and are only
visible in the inside</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1183.</span>&mdash;The Collegiate Church of Crail. Plan.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">of the nave. The windows of the aisles are all modern. The piers are
round and bear simple caps (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1184">1184</a>), and these and the clerestory
windows are plainly of a very late date, although the cap mouldings (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_1184">1184</a>) have been copied from old forms.</p>

<p>To the east of the nave was the choir, now converted into a vestry 20
feet 6 inches long by 17 feet wide. The chancel arch springs from two
responds, the shafts of which have an ancient appearance, but they have
probably been reconstructed in imitation of ancient work. One of the
small original windows is preserved in the north wall of the chancel. It
is about 18 inches in width, and has a plain pointed arch with chamfer
on edge.</p>

<p>There has been an arch at the west end of the church with similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266">{266}</a></span>
shafts to those of the chancel arch. This arch opened into the tower
which rises against the centre of the west wall of the church, and is
divided into several floors, and provided with a newell stair leading to
them.</p>

<p>The tower (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1185">1185</a>) is a picturesque object, though perfectly
plain. It rises with square angles, without buttresses or other breaks
from the base to the parapet. Its short spire, together with the
projection containing the turret stair, form a pleasing group. The whole
presents a characteristic specimen of our simple Scottish church
steeples.</p>

<p>Although it has been thought that some of the features (above referred
to) belong to the first pointed period, it is much more likely that the
whole structure, except the recent work, dates from the beginning of the
sixteenth century, when the collegiate establishment was instituted, and
when the old parish church appears to have been reconstructed. Several
similar towers of late date in the locality will be illustrated.</p>

<p>The church has apparently been renovated, internally, after the
Reformation, when a good deal of carved oak work has been introduced.
This oak work (Fig. <a href="#fig_1186">1186</a>) is now employed as a lining of the walls along
the south and east sides of the church, and is obscured by a number of
pews which abut against it. It is excellent work of the period, and it
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267">{267}</a></span></p>

panels contains a shield with a coat of arms, apparently that of
Cunningham of Barns, with the initials A. C. and the date 1605. When the
church was handed over to the town the rights of Cunningham of Barns
were reserved. He had thus some interest in the church or lands. This
carved work seems to have been the gift of Alexander Cunningham, who at
the above date was Laird of Barns. The arms of his wife, Helen, daughter
of Thomas Myrton of Cambo, are seen, with her initials, on the smaller
panel to the right. Another shield bears the coat and initials of
Katherine Lindsay, wife of Thomas Myrton of Cambo, with the date 1598.
Other shields (not shown in the illustration) bear the arms of Learmonth
of Balcomie (1594).</p>

<p>This charming old building is one of the few rural parish churches of
mediæval times still used for divine service. The church seems to have
had its origin in a neighbouring holy well. The following extract from
documents in the Vatican gives some account of its origin and
history:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The great number of miracles performed at this well were so
numerous that in 1309 John Abernethy, with the assistance of the
monks of Melrose, procured a shrine to be erected, and dedicated it
to the Holy Mother. In 1413 there were no less than 15,653 pilgrims
of all nations, and the offerings were equal to 1422 merks. In
1430, James <small>I.</small>, King of Scotland, being a good man who loved the
Church, built the Abbey of the Holy Cross at Edinburgh, and took
the Chapel of Fairknowe into his protection, added much to it by
the building of houses for the reception of pilgrims, called it
Whitechapel, where he often went and made it a dependant on his own
abbey of the Holy Cross. In 1439, Adam Hepburn of Hailes built a
choir all arched with stone, agreeable to the mode of Peter de
Main, and so it continued in great prosperity as a place of
sanctity until the year 1540, that the cup of vengeance was full,
and heresy covered the North.”</p></div>

<p>Whitekirk was a dependency of Holyrood, as mentioned in the above
extract. It was a great place of pilgrimage, and was visited, amongst
others, by Pope Pius <small>II.</small> (Æneas Sylvius), who came to render thanks to
the Virgin for his safe landing in Scotland.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the east end was used as a church and the
west end as a school. In 1760 the Parish of Tynningham was added to
Whitekirk, and some of the fittings of the former were brought to the
latter. Thus the Haddington gallery in the north transept was adorned
with the front of the gallery from Tynningham. During this century some
attempts have been made to improve the structure. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">{270}</a></span> 1832 a “pseudo
south transept” was built, and the Seacliffe gallery (which resembles a
large Dutch cabinet) was introduced.</p>

<p>The town of Mid-Calder is situated in the western part of the County of
Mid-Lothian.</p>

<p>The church was begun in the sixteenth century by Master Peter
Sandilands, Rector of Mid-Calder, a younger son of the sixth Knight of
Calder. Having raised the walls of the vestry or revestry and laid the
foundations of the choir, and being then an old man, he provided the
money for the entire completion of the church, including the nave,
tower, &amp;c., and paid a sum over to Sir James Sandilands of Calder (his
nephew) and his son John, who bound themselves to complete the structure
according to a bond engrossed in the public records. This bond is to the
following effect:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The actual building (Fig. <a href="#fig_1199">1199</a>) consists of a choir with tripartite apse
having a sacristy or vestry to the east, and it has been carried out, so
far as completed, very much in terms of the foregoing bond.</p>

<p>The vestry, which projects from the east end of the choir, seems to have
been erected before the bond was executed, and the foundations of the
choir seem to have been laid at that time. The remainder of the choir
was apparently carried out afterwards, but the nave, which was carefully
specified in the bond, was never erected.</p>

<p>The vestry contains two stories, the lower one being a burial vault,
which is “pendit” or vaulted, while the upper floor forms the vestry.

wall is carried up with rough masonry, and without any windows or
openings, and has the water table and corbels prescribed as suitable for
the roof of a cloister walk along that side (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1201">1201</a>). The choir
roof has been intended to be vaulted and the lower courses of the
springing are built, but the vault was never completed. The springings
show that the vault was intended to be groined. It is specified to have
a “cross brace and rinruif,” like a chapel in St. Giles’ Church, but the
meaning of these terms is not definite.</p>

<p>At the west end of the choir a very thick wall is built on each side,
with a pointed arch between (described as a brace) to support the

modern belfry has been carried up upon it. In the north pier is a
“turngreis” or wheel stair described as leading to the rood loft, but

<p>The altar was to be built with ashlar, and the floor paved and steps
placed before the altar. The above instructions have, so far as the
structure is executed, been carefully complied with, and the edifice
presents a favourable example of the work of the early part of the
sixteenth century. Ornament has not been spared, and is specially

mouldings terminate. These shields generally contain the arms of the
Sandilands family and their connections the Douglases, of which several

north-west corner of the college quadrangle.</p>

<p>The chapel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1208">1208</a>) is a long narrow building, with a three-sided
apsidal east end, measuring inside the walls about 122 feet 6 inches in
length by about 28 feet in width. It is divided into six bays by
projecting buttresses, and has a large window filled with mullions and
tracery in each bay on the north side, except the second one from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_288" id="page_288">{288}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">west, which contains a doorway. Similar large windows are continued
round the apse (but the centre one is built up), and there is also one
in the east bay of the south side. Over the west doorway there is a
large west window (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1207">1207</a>) of four lights, with solid built
mullions and loop tracery enclosed within a round arch. All the other
large windows just referred to have pointed arches (except the second
from the east end on the north side), the tracery in those of the apse
and in each adjoining window being modern. The other four north windows
have, like the large west window, a solid built central mullion going
right up to the apex of the arch, and having each half filled with the
usual loop tracery. This mode of division of the tracery of a window by
a large central built mullion into two distinct portions, each filled
with its own tracery, is not uncommon in Scotland, as, for instance, at
Seton College, where, however, the mullion divides into two arches and
forms two pointed divisions in the arch-head. Besides the north doorway</p>

<p class="nind">already mentioned, there are two to the quadrangle and one in the west
end, all having elliptic arched tops. The mouldings of the west doorway
have bases, but no caps. The south side of the chapel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1209">1209</a>) forms
a complete contrast to the north side. Instead of large windows
occupying each bay, small clerestory windows, with flat arch-heads,
occur at intervals along the top of the wall, while the lower part of
the wall is left plain, being doubtless intended as a provision for a
covered cloister walk. This, however, was never carried out, but instead
of it Bishop Stewart (1532-1545) erected a building against this side of
the chapel, consisting of two floors, and containing a library, a jewel
house, vestry, and class-rooms. These were taken down and re-erected on
the same site about 1725, and about fifty years afterwards were
destroyed by fire, when the south side of the chapel assumed its present
appearance, being “cased and buttressed with granite as we now see
it.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Dr. Macpherson further tells us that the coats<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_290" id="page_290">{290}</a></span> of arms which
now adorn this side of the chapel had been nearly all on the walls of
the library, and, having escaped the fire, were, along with some others,
inserted in the new granite work. These arms, along with many other
coats throughout the building and the college, have been minutely
described.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> We need only mention here the arms of the founder of the

<p class="nind">double folding doors about 5 feet 9 inches wide by 7 feet 3 inches high.
The side portions of the screen within the choir form a continuation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_295" id="page_295">{295}</a></span>
the canopied stalls occupying each side of the choir. Owing to the
circumstance of the nave having been fitted up as a library, the ancient
arrangement of the screen with its rood loft, ambone, and altars on the
nave side were destroyed. Dr. Macpherson, in the paper already referred
to, has by illustrations and description traced its original
construction, and to this the reader is referred.</p>

<p>The tower at the south-west corner (Fig. <a href="#fig_1211">1211</a>) is not quite square,
measuring over the walls about 29 feet from north to south, and about 4
feet less from east to west. It has massive corner buttresses, with
numerous stepped intakes towards the top, similar to the buttresses of
the chapel, being a style of buttress of very frequent occurrence in
Scottish late churches, as, for example, at Stirling Church. The tower
is finished with one of the few crown steeples remaining in Scotland,
being, with that of St. Giles’, Edinburgh, and the Tolbooth, Glasgow,
the only three surviving of those which we could at one time boast. The
general style of the structure is very similar to that of St. Giles’,
but in this case there are only four arches thrown from the angles of
the tower to the central lantern (Fig. <a href="#fig_1213">1213</a>), while in the case of St.
Giles’ there are eight, which produce a fuller and richer effect. The
tower (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1211">1211</a>) is about 63 feet in height to the top of the
battlements. From that point to the base of the lantern pillars (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1212">1212</a>) is about 15 feet 9 inches, from whence to the top of the cross is
about 20 feet. The total height is thus about 99 feet.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The upper part of the steeple was blown down in a violent storm on 7th
February 1633. Spalding, under that date,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> says:&mdash;“This hideous
winds was marked to be such, as the like had never been seen here in
these parts, for it would overturn countrymen’s houses to the ground,
and some persons suddenly smo’red within, without relief. It also threw
down the stately crown bigged of curious eslar work, off the steeple of
King’s College of Old Aberdeen, whilk was thereafter re-edified and
built up, little inferior to the first.” The part blown down was
probably only the lantern on the top of the four arches, the details of
this part having a decidedly Renaissance character, and being different
from the other parts of the tower. Doubtless the arches themselves would
suffer in the crash, and would require repairing and rebuilding in part,
which was evidently done, as the date 1634 is carved on the soffit of
the crossing. This difference of detail is interesting, as showing how
persistently these old designers wrought in the style of their time.
Although it is evident that the present lantern is not quite the same as
the original one, it must be admitted to be an extremely happy and
picturesque composition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_296" id="page_296">{296}</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with the rebuilding Spalding mentions two names. First,
under the year 1640 he says:&mdash;“Dr. Gordon, medicinar, and one of the
founded members of the College of Old Aberdeen, and common procurator
thereof, departed this life upon the 10th of March, in his own house in
Old Aberdeen; a godly, grave, and learned man; singular in publick works
about the college, and putting up on the steeple thereof the stately and
glorious crown, which you see thereon, which was thrown down by the
wind.” Second, under the year 1642 he says:&mdash;“Saturday the 10th
September, George Thomson, Master Mason, new come frae Strathboggie to
Aberdeen, suddenly fell over Thomas Thomson’s stair, and with the fall
became speechless and senseless, and departed this life upon the
Thursday thereafter. An excellent mason, of singular device; he builded
sundry brave buildings; among the rest, he re-edified the steeple of the
College Kirk of Old Aberdeen.” It has been supposed<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> that Dr. Gordon
was the architect who designed the lantern, but the same claim might be
put forward for the then Bishop, for in Gordon’s description of Aberdeen
(p. 23) we are told&mdash;“Bot the crown was quicklie afterwards restored in
a better forme and condition, by the direction of Patrick Forbes of
Corse, then Bishop of Aberdeen.” It is quite as likely that Thomson was
both the architect and builder, and that the bishop and Dr. Gordon were
the men of affairs.</p>

<p>The old lantern, which had stood for upwards of a century, appears to
have been neglected and to have fallen into a state of disrepair, as in
1620 the authorities ordained “that the heid of the gryt stepill sould
be mendit in steane leid and tymer as the samen was abefoir;”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> but
evidently nothing was done, and so it yielded to the storm.</p>

<p>Most of the windows on the west front of the tower appear to be modern.</p>

<p>This tower, with its crown and most of the chapel, is built of
sandstone.</p>

<p>The church stands at the west end of Queensferry, on the north side of
the street, and the description of its situation in the oldest extant
charter relating to it, which is of the year 1457, is quite intelligible
at this time. James Dundas of Dundas grants “to God and the Virgine
Mary, and brethren of the Order of the Virgine Mary of Mount Carmel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_301" id="page_301">{301}</a></span>
and their successors, a piece of ground lying in the town of the Ferry,
with the pertinents, with the yard and green adjacent to the church of
the Virgine Mary, and whole houses builded in form of a monastrie, as
also that other piece of ground lying betwixt the burn which runs near
the cross of the said town on the east parts [this burn can still be
identified where it comes down by the road immediately to the west of
the town house] and the highway [the present main street of Queensferry]
and ditch that goes towards Echline [a neighbouring farm, and still
known by this name] on the south parts, and the rivolute [still to be

<p class="nind">walls (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1214">1214</a>). It has a south transept projecting 22 feet 9
inches and 25 feet in width. The crossing is separated from the three
limbs of the church by projecting piers (Fig. <a href="#fig_1216">1216</a>) carrying round
arches, above which rises the central tower. When the masonry which
blocked up the archway leading into the choir was lately taken down, it
was found that there had been a parapet about 3 feet high separating the
crossing from the choir. The responds of the massive parapet coping were
discovered wrought on the stones of the piers on either side. The choir
and crossing only have stone vaults. These are barrel vaults, as shown
in the view of the choir (Fig. <a href="#fig_1217">1217</a>), where the vault is pointed, and in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_304" id="page_304">{304}</a></span> crossing (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1216">1216</a>), where it is round and at right angles to
that of the choir, from which it is cut off and separated by the tower
arch. The springing of the tower arches is kept below that of the vault
over the crossing, as is usually done, in similar circumstances, in late
structures, so as to avoid the difficulties of groined vaulting. The
roof covering of the choir is of large overlapping stones, wrought after
the manner so often found in the castles and churches of the fifteenth
century. A wide gutter runs along the eaves (Fig. <a href="#fig_1218">1218</a>), from which the

features often found in the halls of castles, notably at Borthwick. On
the outside of the east end between these two smaller windows over the
large one there is a niche, which probably held a statue of the Virgin.
It is surrounded with various shields, the charges of which are effaced.
Above this, on the apex of the gable, there remains the corbelled base
of a belfry. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_306" id="page_306">{306}</a></span> window in the tower above referred to is peculiar, as
will be seen from an enlarged sketch (Fig. <a href="#fig_1228">1228</a>). It has a
deeply-splayed sill and lintel, with moulded jambs butting against them
at top and bottom. The piscina is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1229">1229</a>, and the ambry and
sedilia are seen in the view of the choir (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1217">1217</a>) and in the
enlarged drawings (Figs. <a href="#fig_1230">1230</a> and <a href="#fig_1231">1231</a>). On either side of the choir
there is a row of large splayed corbels at the springing of the arched
roof, which seems to indicate that there was an upper room over the
choir.</p>

on Plan. The intermediate floor, having been of timber, was supported on
stone corbels. In each room there is a fireplace in the south wall; the
one in the lower room is about 6 feet wide, and is suggestive of having
been used for a kitchen; and there can be no doubt (as will be seen from
the terms of a charter to be quoted) but that these rooms formed a
residence. From the lower room there is a square window (now built up)
looking into the choir. It is immediately under the vault, and measures
about 3 feet wide by 4 feet high, and had probably some kind of closing
shutter. The windows of these rooms are all square-headed, and
overlooked the monastery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_307" id="page_307">{307}</a></span></p>

contemporaneous with the monastery. The similar tower at Torphichen
Church, about eight miles distant, that of Dysart on the opposite shore,
and various other examples throughout the country are finished in the
same way. In the rocks on the shore adjoining there has been cut out a
haven for small boats, which is traditionally believed to have been the
work of the friars.</p>

<p>This monastery and church were founded and endowed by the family of
Dundas of Dundas, it is believed, about the year 1330. The earliest
notice of it is about a century later, in a charter of confirmation
dated 1st October 1457, granted by Lord Seton, Baron of Winchburgh, of a
charter granted by James Dundas of Dundas, dated 6th March 1440, the
terms of which have already been quoted. The</p>

James <small>VI.</small> disponed to Sir Walter Dundas the whole revenue of the
establishment, “together with the kirk of the said place, and whole
bounds, with the steeple and houses above the same.” The place has ever
since remained in the possession of the same family.</p>

<p>The present structure is evidently, from its style, of a late date. The
construction of the vaulting, with its low arches at the crossing, and
pointed vault covered with stone roof over the choir; the plain outline
of the tower and walls, without buttress or break of any kind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_309" id="page_309">{309}</a></span> and the

<p>A structure partly old and partly new, which stands beside the mansion
house of Yester, the seat of the Marquis of Tweeddale. Its position is
very fine, situated as it is by the side of a clear flowing stream, and
surrounded by splendidly wooded braes.</p>

<p>The construction of the old part of the building, as seen in the
interior, is very massive and, considering its small dimensions,
imposing, and it remains in a good state of preservation.</p>

<p>The edifice (Fig. <a href="#fig_1232">1232</a>) consists of a choir and transepts. Of the nave
hardly anything exists, and there is nothing to indicate that it ever
was built. The present west wall is modern, probably of this century.
The choir measures, internally, 13 feet from east to west by 18 feet 6
inches wide. The total length across the transepts is about 53 feet 6
inches from north to south by 13 feet in width, all inside dimensions.
It will be observed that the nave and choir are not quite in the same
line.</p>

<p>The crossing (Fig. <a href="#fig_1233">1233</a>) is covered with a pointed barrel vault in
continuation of that of the choir, and is supported at the springing by
very massive low round arches, which span the entrance to each transept.
The choir vault is separated from the crossing by a late arch, supported
on pillasters of a Renaissance form, and it has been emphasised by
having ribs on the surface of the vault, as shown on the Plan by dotted
lines, but these do not now exist. The transepts are also vaulted with
plain pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_310" id="page_310">{310}</a></span> vaults carried to a considerable height, but cut off from
the crossing, as at Ladykirk and Queensferry, by the arches introduced
to carry the central vault of the crossing. As the church was without
buttresses, the walls are of considerable thickness (not less than 4
feet) in order to resist the pressure of the arches. In the north wall
of the south transept, near the apex of the roof (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1233">1233</a>), there
is a small door, now built up, which probably gave access to a small
chamber in the haunch of the vault over the crossing.</p>

<p>In the east wall of the north transept there is a piscina (Fig. <a href="#fig_1234">1234</a>),
enriched with carved crockets round the ogee arch. The basin is, as
usual, broken away. On one side of the arch is a shield, having a
smaller shield on the dexter side, bearing three inescutcheons, and on
the sinister side three cinquefoils, being the arms of Hay of Tweeddale.</p>

<p>The piscina is 22½ inches wide, measuring over the enrichments, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_311" id="page_311">{311}</a></span> 26
inches high, and 3 feet 3 inches from the floor up to the level of the
basin.</p>

<p>An earlier church than that just described existed here, and was
dedicated to St. Bothan, after whom also the parish was named, until, on
the erection of the present mansion house, the baronial name of the
extensive domains of Yester superseded the old parochial name.</p>

<p>Præpositura de Bothans, and is rated at £40. The territory of Yester was
from the twelfth century in the possession of the family of Gifford, and
in 1418 it passed, by marriage, into the possession of Sir William Hay
of Locherwart, with whose descendants it still remains.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>In 1421 Sir William founded the Collegiate Church of St. Bothan for a
provost, six prebendaries, and two singing boys. And he and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_315" id="page_315">{315}</a></span>
successors endowed it with sufficient revenues. After the Reformation it
continued to be the parish church till 1708, when a new church was built
in the neighbouring village of Gifford.</p>

<p>This is one of the best preserved of the old churches of Scotland, and
although it has suffered severely by various renovations and
restorations, it is still a building of very considerable interest. The
church occupies a high situation on the Castle Hill, and as approached
up the steep streets, the lofty east end which first appears to view,
with its prominent buttresses and tall windows, has a most imposing and
picturesque effect.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The edifice consists of two divisions, the nave
and choir, which were built at two different periods. The nave, which is
the oldest part, is undoubtedly the church referred to in the
Chamberlain’s Accounts for the year from July 1413 to June 1414, in
which he “discharges himself of the issues of ayre held at Stirling,
because it was granted to the work of the parish church which had been
burnt.” Of the earlier church which had been burnt nothing now remains.
The date of the east end or choir is known to be between 1507 and 1520.</p>

<p>The building (Fig. <a href="#fig_1238">1238</a>) consists, from end to end, of a central nave
with north and south aisles (the aisles being vaulted in stone), an
eastern apse, and a western tower. The nave has five bays, the choir
three bays, and they are separated by a wide bay, which may be termed
the crossing. The crossing now serves as an entrance hall to the two
churches which are located in the edifice, walls being built across each
side of the crossing so as to enclose the choir as one church and the
nave as the other. The total internal length of the building, exclusive
of the apse and tower, is about 160 feet by about 55 feet in width;
including apse and tower the internal length is about 200 feet.</p>

<p>The original entrance to the church was through the western tower, and
as the ground rises considerably towards the west, there must have been
steps down to the floor of the nave. The western doorway was destroyed
in 1818, when the sill of the window above was lowered into the space
occupied by the door arch, but the bases and lower part of the door
jambs still remain (Fig. <a href="#fig_1239">1239</a>). The tower, which is vaulted, opens into
the nave (as at Linlithgow) through a lofty pointed arch, springing from
moulded responds (Fig. <a href="#fig_1240">1240</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_316" id="page_316">{316}</a></span></p>

<p>The piers of the nave (with the exception of two) are round and massive

carved and moulded capitals (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1241">1241</a>), with but slight projection
or undercutting. The moulded bases, where not destroyed, are also round
and of slight projection, those of the responds terminating on
semi-octagonal plinths. The general appearance of these pillars
illustrates what is so often found in Scotland (both</p>

onwards, viz., a tendency to imitate Norman and early pointed details.
This tendency is also seen in the nave piers of Dunkeld Cathedral, in
the piers and arches of the naves of Aberdour Church and Dysart Church,
in the imitation of first pointed work in the late cloisters of Melrose,
and many other examples which might be cited. But the later counterfeit
is never perfect, there being always some touch of contemporary design
which reveals the imitation. The two exceptional piers, above referred
to as not being cylindrical, are the fourth piers (Fig. <a href="#fig_1242">1242</a>) from the
west end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1243">1243</a>). These piers are composed of clustered shafts with

room was reached by a wheel staircase in the north wall, where the door
leading to it is still to be seen. This staircase is now filled with the
chimney flues of a heating apparatus. The bay between the tower piers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_320" id="page_320">{320}</a></span>

of the church being occupied with modern staircases, vestries, and

appears to have proceeded so far that a service, by order of the Provost

oriel window to the east end of the church, somewhat in the same way as
the apse of St. Michael’s, Linlithgow. It is wider than the central
division of the choir, and fits on awkwardly to it, causing the two side
divisions of the apse to be lost to view when one looks from the west

<p>There is a roughly formed square recess, about 12 inches wide (see Fig.

south-east corner (see Plan and Fig. <a href="#fig_1250">1250</a>) there is an ogee-headed
recess, about 7 inches high by 5 inches wide and 2½ inches deep, at
about 3 feet 6 inches from the floor. There are recesses somewhat
similar to the latter at Paisley Abbey.</p>

contains the arms of Durham of Grange (Fig. <a href="#fig_1254">1254</a>); but as no member of

<p class="nind">to the Durhams of Mollet, one of whom, with the above initials, married
Eliz. Murray. This would correspond with the initials and lower shield
on the slab (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1254">1254</a>) in which the Durham and Murray arms are
impaled. The adjoining slab exhibits six shields. One of these contains
the founder’s arms (Fig. <a href="#fig_1255">1255</a>), and another a curious figure arranged
saltier-wise. Nothing can be determined as to the carving on the other
shields. The remaining slab contains the arms and initials of Duncan
Forrester (Fig. <a href="#fig_1256">1256</a>), possibly the son of the founder, and the Erskine
arms with the initials M. E. A consecration cross is shown (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1253">1253</a>), which is carved on the north wall of the chapel.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig_1257">1257</a> are shown detached portions of a niche, including the
canopy and corbel, lying on the floor. The exterior base of the church,
which is partly returned round the west side of this chapel, is shown in
Fig. <a href="#fig_1258">1258</a>.</p>

<p>There were north and south doorways to the nave, opposite each other, in
the second bay from the west. The south one had a large porch, now
destroyed.</p>

<p>The tower, which is oblong in plan, measures about 31 feet from north to
south by about 22 feet from east to west, and, according to Mr. Ronalds,
it is 85 feet high to the top of the parapet, and 15 feet more to the
apex<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_330" id="page_330">{330}</a></span> of the spirelet. It is quite evident that it has been built at two
periods. The lower part, judging from the window mouldings and what
remains of the base of the west door, is contemporary with the church,
or of early fifteenth century work. The upper part is contracted to
nearly a square of about 25 feet on Plan, there being a balcony on the
north and one on the south (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1239">1239</a>). A turret stair in the
north-west corner gives access from the church to the top. This tower,
especially as seen from the west, is very picturesque, where the long
unbroken line of the stair turret contrasts beautifully with recessed
outlines of the other corner (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1248">1248</a>).</p>

<p>This tower is amongst the best specimens of the Scottish architecture of
the sixteenth century, as applied to ecclesiastical structures.</p>

church, where his arms (Fig. <a href="#fig_1259">1259</a>) still remain on the interior of the
north side of the choir, quartered with those of his wife Isobel, second
daughter of Sir John Stewart of Innermeith and Lorn. The lady’s arms, it
will be observed, occupy the first and fourth quarters.</p>

<p>This is one of the few collegiate churches in Scotland which were
entirely finished and still remain unaltered. It is of a cruciform plan
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1260">1260</a>) and has a small western tower entering from the church by a
narrow doorway. The building measures internally from east to west along
the south side 62 feet 1½ inches, and along the north side 64 feet 6½
inches by 18 feet 5½ inches in breadth, and the walls are 14 feet 3
inches high from the floor to the wall head. The measurements over the
transepts are 64 feet 5 inches from north to south, by 15 feet 10 inches
in width (inside measure). The tower is a small apartment of 6 feet 11
inches by 4 feet 9 inches.</p>

<p>There are two entrances, one being at the west end of the south wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_331" id="page_331">{331}</a></span>
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1261">1261</a>). It is round-arched with a bead and hollow moulding and a
rude string cap. The other is a plain lintelled doorway in the north
transept.</p>

<p>In each of the north and south walls of the transept there is a
traceried window, the one to the south (Fig. <a href="#fig_1262">1262</a>) having three lights
and the other (Fig. <a href="#fig_1263">1263</a>) two lights. The walls are of considerable
thickness, and the tracery is well recessed (Fig. <a href="#fig_1264">1264</a>) and gives, in
consequence,</p>

<p>The other windows are simple and such as are found in castles and minor
churches. That adjoining the entrance to the south transept is
interesting from having its sconsion arch (Fig. <a href="#fig_1265">1265</a>) neatly constructed
so as to die away upon the splay. In the west gable there are two narrow
windows. The lintels of these, instead of being level, lie at the same
angle as the slope of the gable, and just a little below it (Fig. <a href="#fig_1266">1266</a>).
A similar kind of window may be observed at Dunblane at the east end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_332" id="page_332">{332}</a></span>
the room over the north aisle of the choir. The transepts each open from
the church by a segmental arch (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1265">1265</a>), springing from splayed</p>

the top of the caps measures 8 feet 2 inches, and the arch has a rise
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_333" id="page_333">{333}</a></span> 2 feet 10 inches, in a width of 11 feet 9½ inches. It is difficult
to say how the roof at this part was finished originally. The present
roof at the east end is of considerable antiquity, having timbers about
6 inches square, but the part resting on the transept arch is
comparatively modern. That it was not finished as it is now is almost
certain, as there appears to have been a gable over the arch, separating
the transept roofs from the main roof.</p>

<p>There are several ambries in the church. The one at the east end of the
south wall is handsome (Fig. <a href="#fig_1268">1268</a>), having a pointed ogee arched</p>

In the east jamb of the south transept arch (see Plan and Fig. <a href="#fig_1265">1265</a>)
there is a narrow arched recess about 6½ inches wide by 3½ inches in
depth.</p>

<p>The east end of the church appears to have been covered with tapestry,
as the laths for attaching it to are still in position on the walls. At
the west wall and the end walls of the transepts the pieces securing the
feet of the rafters are brought down the walls flush with the face, and
would also afford facilities for hanging tapestry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_334" id="page_334">{334}</a></span></p>

<p>A peculiar feature of the church is the rise of the floor at the west
end by two steps. The steps appear to be original, and may possibly be
in connection with a burial vault beneath.</p>

<p>In the exterior of the north wall of the transept (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1263">1263</a>) are
inserted two shields. The one over the doorway (Fig. <a href="#fig_1269">1269</a>) contains the

<p>The ancient town of Maybole, which is situated on the side of a hill
about nine miles south from Ayr, was formerly the capital of Carrick,
and contained the castle of the Earl of Cassillis<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and the town

Reformation the house of the provost was the scene of a celebrated
debate between John Knox and Quentin Kennedy, Abbot of Crosraguel, in
September 1561.</p>

<p>The college stands on gently sloping ground near the base of the hill on
which the town is situated, and is now enclosed within the streets.</p>

<p>In 1371 a chapel was founded in Maybole by Sir John Kennedy of Dunure,
and endowed for one clerk and three chaplains. This was probably the
earliest foundation of the kind established in Scotland, but it had many
successors as collegiate churches in the following century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_339" id="page_339">{339}</a></span></p>

<p>In Abercrummie’s description of Carrick,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> written in the end of the
seventeenth century, the collegiate church is mentioned as being still
entire, “being now used as the burial-place of the Earl of Cassillis,
and other gentlemen who contributed to the putting of a roofe upon it,
when it was decayed.” It is further mentioned that the “Colledge
consisted of a rector and three prebends, whose stalls are all of them
yet extant, save the rector’s.”</p>

<p>The houses or “stalls” of the prebends are now all gone, and the church
is again roofless. The freestone has been taken away from many of the
buttresses, and the tracery of the windows is broken and most of the
windows built up.</p>

<p>The church as it now stands (Fig. <a href="#fig_1272">1272</a>) consists of a simple oblong 52
feet long by 18 feet wide internally, but there are evidences of its
having been altered. There was a small sacristy on the north side, with
a good pointed doorway leading into the church.</p>

Windows.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Both in the north and south walls (Fig. <a href="#fig_1273">1273</a>) of the edifice there is a
very narrow pointed and cusped window, which does not correspond with
the other details of the building, and close to the narrow window in the
south wall there is a dressed corner, now built against, which seems to
indicate a complete change in the structure at this point. The east
window and the two windows adjoining it in the north and south sides
still retain part of their tracery (Fig. <a href="#fig_1274">1274</a>), which is of a late
character. A recess with pointed arch-head for a tomb or an Easter
sepulchre in the north wall of the choir (Fig. <a href="#fig_1275">1275</a>) contains mouldings
enriched with imitations of the dog-tooth, and the arches of the
south-west doorway (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1273">1273</a>) have also similar dog-tooth
ornaments. The church having been founded in 1371, when the first
pointed period (to which the dog-tooth belongs) had long passed away,
there can be no doubt of the above ornaments being very late revivals,
even if the style of their execution did not make that apparent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_341" id="page_341">{341}</a></span></p>

<p>The south-west doorway is, however, a good late <i>adaptation</i> or
imitation of a thirteenth century design, like other imitations of early
work which were common during the third pointed period. The doorway is
surmounted by a shield bearing the Kennedy arms.</p>

<p>The west end (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1273">1273</a>) has a buttress in the centre, while in the
inside opposite it the recess of a built up window is observable (see
Plan), thus further indicating alteration. It seems probable that the
church was originally small, and the narrow windows, above referred to,
may possibly be remains of the original fabric. Then at a later date the</p>

traceried windows, the recess in the choir, and the south-west

barrel vault (Fig. <a href="#fig_1276">1276</a>).</p>

<p>Abercrummie further says&mdash;“On the north syde of the kirk is the buriall
place of the laird of Colaine within ane enclosure of new square-stone
lately built.” This enclosure remains, and its architecture corresponds
with the date mentioned, viz., seventeenth century. The entrance doorway
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_1276">1276</a>) is elaborate, but considerably decayed, and over<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_342" id="page_342">{342}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="BIGGAR_COLLEGIATE_CHURCH_Lanarkshire" id="BIGGAR_COLLEGIATE_CHURCH_Lanarkshire"></a>BIGGAR COLLEGIATE CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Lanarkshire</span>.</h2>

<p>The town of Biggar lies in a valley in the Upper Ward of Lanarkshire,
through which communication is obtained between the upper reaches of the
Clyde and the Tweed. From an early period Biggar was a rectory in the
Deanery of Lanark. The parson of Biggar is mentioned in deeds of the
twelfth century, and several of the rectors held important appointments
at Court.</p>

<p>In 1545 the Church of St. Nicholas was founded and endowed by Malcolm,
Lord Fleming, the Lord High Chancellor of Scotland. The charter of
foundation still exists. It was addressed by Lord Fleming to Cardinal
Beaton, and states that the church was to be erected in honour of the
Holy Trinity, the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Nicholas the patron of
Biggar, and St. Ninian. The purpose of the foundation was to support a
provost, eight canons or prebendaries, four singing boys, and six poor
nuns, and the presentations and endowment of these officials were
reserved to the Lord Fleming. The special duties of the prebendaries
were as follow:&mdash;The first prebendary was to instruct the singing boys
in music, the second was to be master of the grammar school, the third
was to act as sacristan&mdash;to ring the bell, to light the tapers on the
four altars, and to attend to the vestments and ornament thereof&mdash;and
the fourth prebendary had charge of the poor nuns and gave them their
allowances. A hospital was to be provided for the poor nuns, and
suitable houses were to be erected for the provost and canons.</p>

<p>During the progress of the work, Malcolm, Lord Fleming, died. The
building was carried on by his son, and scarcely completed before the
Reformation supervened to interrupt the work.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>This church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1277">1277</a>), like many of the collegiate edifices erected
prior to this time, is cruciform in plan, consisting of chancel with
apsidal east end, transept, and nave, with square tower over the
crossing. There are no aisles in any part of the church.</p>

<p>It is supposed by Grose (who saw the building more than 100 years ago,
before it was restored) that the nave, which is built with whinstone
rubble work, was probably part of an original church which was enlarged
by Lord Fleming, by the addition of a transept and chancel. This may
have been the case, but the nave is now so completely altered and
modernised that it is impossible to say. The chancel, transept, and
tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_344" id="page_344">{344}</a></span></p>

believed that there was also a door in the west end. A small wheel
staircase in the south-east angle of the north transept leads to the

buttressed chancel and transept. The windows are all pointed and filled
with simple tracery, and the buttresses are of simple but good design,
having a broad water table on top, and no pinnacles.</p>

<p>The windows are each set in a rectangular recess, which, although a
novelty, cannot be said to to be an improvement. It is in keeping with
the square forms of the Renaissance then being introduced. The arches
and jambs have triple splays. The doorway in the south transept is a
little more ornamental. The arch is round, as very usual in Scotland,
and there are two recessed arches, the inner one moulded and the outer
having enriched caps (Fig. <a href="#fig_1280">1280</a>).</p>

<p>The tower contains a room on the first floor with a fireplace, and over
it is the belfry.</p>

<p>It is understood that the ancient roof was of oak, and that the timbers
in the chancel were gilt and emblazoned, doubtless with the arms of the
Flemings, who were buried there.</p>

the middle of the twelfth century it was bestowed by William de
Sumerville on Glasgow Cathedral, which grant was confirmed by Pope
Alexander <small>III.</small> in 1170. The existing building is, however, of much more
recent date. It formed the north wing of the parish church, and was

<p class="nind">described in the <i>Memoire of the Somervilles</i>, written about the end of
the seventeenth century:&mdash;“The yle itself is but little, however neatly
and conveniently built opposite the middle (on the North side) of the
church; all aisles, both within and without, haveing pinickles upon all
the corners, wherein are engraven, besydes other imagerie the armes of
the Somervills and Sinclaires (the family of the wife of the founder),
very discernable to the occular aspectione, albeit it be two hundereth

<p>The parish church, which formerly consisted of chancel, nave, and
transept, has been removed, and there now only remains a portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_350" id="page_350">{350}</a></span>
north transept, which has been used as the burial-place of the Lords
Carnwath-Somerville till the latter half of the seventeenth century, and
the Lockharts since then.</p>

<p>The building (Fig. <a href="#fig_1282">1282</a>) stands north and south, and measures about 25
feet long by 22 feet 6 inches wide (externally). The style (Fig. <a href="#fig_1283">1283</a>)</p>

<p class="nind">is generally like that of the contemporary churches of Scotland; but the
large north window is remarkable from having a closer affinity than
usual with the English perpendicular. In order to carry the heavy stone
roof, shown in the sketch, the building is covered with a pointed barrel
vault such as is generally employed for this purpose; and, as frequently
happens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_351" id="page_351">{351}</a></span> the vault is divided into bays, and is ornamented with
decorative ribs springing from shafts attached to the wall. Some of the
caps bear the arms of the founder and his spouse. The vaulting gives
rise to the massive buttresses employed, and to the depressed form of
the two-light square-headed side windows on each side, one of which is
seen in the sketch.</p>

<p>The building having been restored, several new features have been added.
Thus the belfry on the south gable and the cross on the north gable are
modern. The north doorway under the large window is also an insertion,
but is believed to have been formed with the stones of the old doorway
of the church. The pinnacles referred to in the above quoted description
still exist (although partly restored), but the coats of arms on the
buttresses are no longer visible. The outline of the arch in the south
gable, which formerly opened from the transept into the church, can
still be traced (see Plan).</p>

<p>The interior contains a fine altar-tomb, bearing the recumbent figures
of Hugh, Lord Somerville, who died in 1549, and his second wife, Janet,
daughter of William Maitland of Ledington, who died about 1550. Lord
Hugh was a great favourite of James V., who frequently visited him at
his Castle of Cowthally.</p>

apparently of older date, but its history is unknown.</p>

sacristan. The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1284">1284</a>) measures within the walls 66 feet in
length by 19 feet in width. The building is a simple oblong, terminating
toward the east in a three-sided apse, and having a square tower
projecting from the centre of the west wall.</p>

<p>The style of the east end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1285">1285</a>) is very remarkable. The forms of
the double windows indicate plainly that they are very late survivals of
spurious Gothic work, and a close examination of the building tends to
confirm this view. The other windows in the side walls have been greatly
altered, but they do not present any features at all like those of the
apse. Over the door to the chancel are two coats of arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_355" id="page_355">{355}</a></span> with the
letters R. L. S. and A. M. S., the dexter shield bearing the Sempill
arms and the sinister the Montgomerie. The square tower at the west end
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1286">1286</a>) is extremely simple, and has no analogy with the work at the
east end.</p>

</div>

<p>There can be little doubt that the tower and most of the side walls are
of about the date of the original foundation, while the east apse has
been added in the sixteenth century, to receive the monument of John,
Lord Sempill, who fell at Flodden in 1513. A few remains of the original
square-headed windows in the side walls are still traceable.</p>

<p>The interior has, within recent times, been divided by two solid walls
into three compartments, so as to form separate private burial-places,
and this operation seems to have caused the further alteration and
building up of the side windows.</p>

<p>In the eastern compartment stands, against the north wall, the large
monument to Lord Sempill (Fig. <a href="#fig_1287">1287</a>), which bears the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>· · · <span class="smcap">John · Lord · Sempil ande · his · Laydi · D · · · Margarita</span> · · ·</p>

<p>It must have been erected after 1513, and shows the last expiring effort
of the Gothic decorative spirit. The cusped half-arch half-lintel is a
kind of compromise between the Gothic and Renaissance, and the exuberant
foliage of the upper portion shows late Gothic forms run wild.</p>

<p>The architecture of the apse windows corresponds in extravagance with
that of the monument.</p>

<p>A monumental slab in the central compartment (Fig. <a href="#fig_1288">1288</a>) is erected in
memory of “Gabriel Sempel,” who died in 1587. This shows the style<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_356" id="page_356">{356}</a></span></p>

<p>The mendicant orders were introduced into Scotland by Alexander II.
(1214-49), who is stated to have founded eight convents for Dominicans,
but only two for Franciscans. From an old undated charter it is believed
that the latter order was established in Elgin under Alexander III., but
their original monastery appears to have fallen into decay. It was,
however, revived under James I. (1424-37) for the order of Observantines
introduced into Scotland by that king.</p>

</div>

<p>Their first convent was in Edinburgh, where these friars were
established in 1446. This convent was followed by one in St. Andrews,
and a third house was settled at Aberdeen in 1450. The order then
extended to Elgin, where it was introduced by John Innes, a member of a
well-known Morayshire family, in 1479. The Franciscans, having no
rentals to be taxed and no lands to alienate, probably fled when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_357" id="page_357">{357}</a></span>
Reformation came. Their convent was plundered by Montrose, but the
church was not demolished, and still stands with its four walls
complete, though sadly damaged. The domestic buildings have been
obliterated or converted to modern uses.</p>

<p>The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1290">1290</a>) is a simple oblong structure, 110 feet in length
by 22 feet in width internally. It had an entrance door for the public
in the north wall, near the west end. From the marks in the wall above
it (Fig. <a href="#fig_1291">1291</a>) there seems to have been a wooden porch or awning over
the doorway.</p>

<p>The church has been well lighted with large traceried windows (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1291">1291</a>) in the east and west end walls, and with six side windows in</p>

<p class="nind">the north wall and one in the south wall. Each of the end windows had
three mullions with intersecting tracery in the arch, and the side
windows were all divided into two lights by a central mullion, with two
curved divisions in the arch. Near the centre of the building, and on
both sides, there occur two small windows, one over the other, the lower
one being single with ogee head, and the upper one having a central
mullion. These windows have evidently been for the purpose of lighting
the rood screen and loft. The lower windows would light the space under
the rood loft, where there was no doubt an altar, and the upper windows
the gallery or space over the screen. The corbels which carried the loft
can still be traced on both sides of the church. A piscina in each of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_358" id="page_358">{358}</a></span> side walls, close to the screen, shows that there were altars
placed against it. In the north window, adjoining the screen, there is a
stone sink, probably used by the priests as a lavatory. At the east end
of the church there is an ambry in each of the side walls, and a window
in the south wall to light the sanctuary. Under it is a recess, probably
used as a sedilia. The conventual buildings have evidently been built to
the south of the church. The junctions of four walls forming buildings
on two sides of a courtyard still remain, and in the south wall of the
church, between the above, may be observed the corbels which carried the
roof of the cloister walk. There are also two doors from this side into
the church. The structure is of a plain and simple style, corresponding
to the character of the mendicant friars who occupied it. It was
doubtless erected soon after the Observantines were introduced in 1479,
and bears the character of the architecture of the period.</p>

<p>After the Reformation the church was no longer used for service.
Criminal Courts sat in it till the middle of the seventeenth century,
and it also served as a place of meeting of the crafts or trades in
Elgin. Afterwards it became a place for Episcopal services, and it is
now the property of the Convent of St. Mary of Mercy.</p>

<p class="nind">the west end (shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1293">1293</a>) was then erected. There was formerly a
spire or steeple, probably at the west end. The church now extends to
six bays in the length (Fig. <a href="#fig_1294">1294</a>), divided by buttresses, and having a
pointed window in each bay. It is fitted up with galleries in the most
incongruous style, but has several good examples of carved bench ends

with its immense window, one of the largest examples of tracery now
remaining in Scotland. It is divided into seven lights, and although it
is of the simplest design, being merely a series of intersecting arches,
an agreeable variety is obtained by stopping several of the bars near
the top from running their full course, and thus obtaining larger
openings, which contrast with the others of smaller size. A similar kind
of design was very frequent in</p>

good form; indeed, it is remarkable, considering its lateness, how pure

<p>Amongst the numerous remains of ancient ecclesiastical structures still
surviving in the Western Isles, the Church of St. Clement, situated near
the south point of Harris, holds a prominent place, being one of the
very few ancient structures in that region which are not ruinous, and
are still in use for public worship.</p>

<p>The origin of the church is uncertain, but it is supposed to have been
originally founded by an emissary from Iona, and to have fallen into
decay during the occupation of the Norsemen. It is thought that the
necessities of the monastery, thus arising, were probably relieved by
David <small>I.</small> “from the revenues of the newly instituted Abbey of Holyrood
House,” and that this may have given the monks of the latter the claim
to St. Clement’s, which they afterwards substantiated.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>It is agreed amongst writers on the subject<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> that the church was
restored or rebuilt by Sir Alexander M‘Leod, Rector of Harris, who seems
to have used the materials of an older building in the restoration. This
is evident from the random manner in which some carved figures are built
into the walls of the west tower.</p>

<p>Mr. Ross points out that Alaster Crotach or Humpback had, in 1498, a
charter from King James <small>IV.</small> for the hereditary lands of Ardmanich, &amp;c.,
and that he was succeeded by his son William, who died in 1553.</p>

<p>The <i>Old Statistical Account</i> informs us that the church was repaired by
the said Alexander M‘Leod, who died (as the inscription on his tomb in
the church bears) in 1527.</p>

<p>Of the domestic buildings of the priory not a stone now remains. The
church was burnt and was repaired in “1784 by the late patriotic Alex.
M‘Leod, Esq., of Harris. After the church was roofed and slated, and the
materials for furnishing it within laid up in it to a considerable
value, it unfortunately took fire at night through the carelessness of
the carpenters, who had left a live coal in it among the timbers. So
zealous, however, was this friend of religion and mankind in his design
of repairing it, that by his orders and at his expense it was soon after
this accident roofed, and it is now [1794], though left unfinished since
the time of his death, used as one of the principal places in the parish
for celebrating divine service.”</p>

<p>The church was again repaired in 1787. About 1866 it had once more
become dilapidated, and was repaired under the supervision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_364" id="page_364">{364}</a></span> Mr.

<p>The building is chiefly remarkable from containing an elaborately
sculptured monument to Alexander M‘Leod of Dunvegan or Harris.</p>

<p>The structure (Fig. <a href="#fig_1298">1298</a>) is small and is cruciform in plan. It has a
square tower at the west end, the full width of the nave, which is
founded on a rock at a higher level than the nave (Fig. <a href="#fig_1299">1299</a>).</p>

<p>The choir is not architecturally distinguished from the nave, and the
whole building is 61 feet in length (internally) by 15 feet in width.</p>

<p>It has a square east end, and is lighted by a large traceried east
window, and by two small windows in the side walls. The former is</p>

<p class="nind">pointed, and is divided by two mullions into three lights. The tracery
in the arch-head consists of a circle divided by six radiating bars.</p>

<p>The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1300">1300</a>) has two square-headed windows and two pointed
windows in the south wall, and one square and one round-headed window in
the north wall (Fig. <a href="#fig_1301">1301</a>), and the entrance doorway, which is in the
north wall, is also square lintelled.</p>

<p>The transept consists of a north and south chapel, which are not exactly
opposite one another. They have square-headed windows in the north,
south, and east walls. Each chapel is entered from the nave by a moulded
and pointed arch (see Figs. <a href="#fig_1300">1300</a> and <a href="#fig_1301">1301</a>)) springing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_368" id="page_368">{368}</a></span> responds. The
latter have both in their section and caps (Fig. <a href="#fig_1302">1302</a>) a certain
resemblance to Norman work. As pointed out by Mr. Muir, the details
indicate the second pointed period, “though, as in the mouldings at
Iona, the adoption of forms resembling Norman and first pointed has
given to it an appearance of greater antiquity.”</p>

<p>The monuments are the most remarkable features in the building. These
are three in number, two of them being placed against the south wall,
one in the choir and one in the nave (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1300">1300</a>) on either side of
the arch leading into the south transept. The third monument is at the

<p>The monument in the choir is the most elaborate, being specially rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_369" id="page_369">{369}</a></span>

the usual recessed arch, a sloping gable-shaped moulding, which encloses
the design on top, and is continued perpendicularly down each side. The
space between the arch and the enclosing moulding is divided into nine
panels, each containing a distinct carving of figures. That in the apex
represents God the Father, holding between his knees a cross bearing a
figure of the Crucifixion. Each of the panels at the sides contains one
or two figures of angels waving censers, and saints holding scrolls. The

<p class="nind">left is a hunting scene, a knight with sword and spear, followed by
attendants holding dogs in leash. The next panel contains three stags,
well carved. To the right of this is a panel representing an angel
holding up a pair of scales to weigh the souls of the departed, in which
process he is interfered with by a demon. A similar scene is carved on
one of the pier caps in the choir of Iona Cathedral (see Fig. <a href="#fig_985">985</a>).</p>

<p>To the right is a long panel containing the following inscription in
Gothic letters:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hic · loculus · cōposuit · · · · Allexāder · filius · Vilm̄i · Mac ·
Clod · dn̄o · de · dūvegan · Anno · dn̄i</span> · <small>Mº · CCCCCº · XXVIIIº</small></p>

<p>The meaning of this apparently is that Alexander, son of William MacLeod
of Dunvegan, made this tomb <small>A.D.</small> 1528.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_370" id="page_370">{370}</a></span></p>

<p>On the pedestal under the arch lies the effigy of the said Alexander
M‘Leod of Dunvegan (Fig. <a href="#fig_1304">1304</a>), clad in full armour, and holding a long
sword with cross hilt. The effigy is unfortunately much decayed. The
head rests on a pillow with an animal above, and the feet rest on a
lion. At the side of the monument a lion encloses the tomb.</p>

<p>The style of the carving and the subjects represented recall the
sculptures at Iona. The figures of the abbot and bishop are similar in
style to that of the abbess at the Iona Nunnery, and the scene of the
angel weighing souls with a demon interfering occurs on one of the caps
in the Iona</p>

<p class="nind">choir. The division of the flat surfaces into panels, each containing a
separate subject, is characteristic of Celtic decoration. The hunting
scene and the ship are also common in Celtic work. The peculiar Celtic
foliage of Iona is here wanting. Enough, however, exists to associate
the style of the work with that of the rest of the Western Isles, while
the Gothic influence is also very distinct.</p>

<p>The date is fixed by the inscription, and the introduction of the
nail-head ornament shows the revival here, as at Iona, of earlier forms,
as above pointed out by Mr. Muir.</p>

<p>The tomb in the recessed arch to the west of the south transept is of
much simpler design than the corresponding one to the east above
described. It consists (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1300">1300</a>) of a semicircular moulded arch
with a hood<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_371" id="page_371">{371}</a></span> moulding stopped on carved corbels at each end. Over the
upper part of the hood a triangular space is enclosed with a moulding,
finished at the apex with a fleur-de-lys. This triangular space contains
an oblong panel, much decayed, exhibiting the Crucifixion, with a figure
on each side. The effigy “represents a man in armour with high peaked
bassinet and camail over a habergeon reaching to the knee. The nature of
the defences of the feet and legs is not indicated. He holds a long,
straight, cross-hilted sword in front, the pommel reaching to the
breast, and the point placed between the feet. A dagger hangs at his
left side, but the military belt is wanting.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>The third tomb is at the end of the south transept. The effigy (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1305">1305</a>) is somewhat similar to the last described, but is much wasted by
exposure.</p>

<p>A remarkable recessed tomb having some analogy with those at Rowdil is
described and figured in a paper by Professor Norman Macpherson in the
<i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>, Vol. <small>XII.</small> p.
583. It consists of a plain round arch in the north wall of the ruined
Church of St. Donan in the island of Eigg. In the wall at the back of
the recess is a large square panel containing sculptures, which “afford
an interesting example of Celtic notions of heraldry.” These<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_372" id="page_372">{372}</a></span> sculptures
appear to represent the Clanranald shield, having in the place of the
first quarter a hand grasping a cross, in the second what appears</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the very numerous small churches and chapels found in
the Western Isles,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> there are comparatively few remains of
monasteries. The original Celtic religious establishments were,
doubtless, monastic in their form and structure, but of convents in the
later sense, corresponding with those so common on the mainland, few
traces are now to be seen. Next to the great Abbey of the Isles at Iona
and the nunnery on the same island, the largest monastic establishment
in the Western Isles of which the structures survive is the Priory of
Oronsay.</p>

<p>This island lies about ten miles west from Jura, and can be most
conveniently reached from Portaskaig, in Islay. The isle is about<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_373" id="page_373">{373}</a></span> two
and three-quarter miles broad from east to west by about two miles from
north to south. It stands at the south end of the larger island of
Colonsay, from which it is separated by a narrow channel, dry at low
tide.</p>

<p>It is traditionally narrated that St. Columba and his companion, St.
Oran, landed on Oronsay after leaving Ireland; but finding that the
latter country could still be seen from the highest point of the island,
they forsook it and sailed to Iona. St. Oran, however, gave his name to
the island, and, together with Colonsay, it seems, from the numerous
remains of churches which once existed on these islands, to have been a
sacred locality, the remains of nine old churches and the sites of three
more&mdash;ten in Colonsay and two in Oronsay&mdash;being still traceable. The
most important appears to have been the Monastery of Kiloran, in
Colonsay, of which no remains now exist. Next to it was the Priory of
Oronsay. This priory of Canons Regular of St. Augustine appears to have
been founded in the fourteenth century by the Lord of the Isles as a
cell of the Abbey of Holyrood at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The priory is situated at the extreme west end of the island, on the
lowermost slope of the <i>Beinn Oronsay</i>, just short of the point where
its rugged cliffs front the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The general arrangement of the buildings (Fig. <a href="#fig_1309">1309</a>) is peculiar. The
ground slopes rapidly from north to south, necessarily carrying the
drainage with it; yet, contrary to the usual custom, the cloisters and
residential buildings were placed to the north of the church. Exclusive
of projections at the north-east and south-west angles, and a mortuary
chapel on the south, the structures occupy a parallelogram about 87 feet
from north to south, by 65 feet from east to west. The latter length is
also that of the church proper, which occupies the south side of the
square, but has at the west end a narthex about 15 feet square
internally, which projects beyond the general range of the buildings.
The walls of the narthex are now level with those of the church, but as
there are roughly hewn corbel stones for carrying a floor overhead, it
is probable this is only the lower stage of a bell-tower, of which the
upper part has been long since demolished. The greater thickness of the
walls and two sadly injured freestone buttresses on its south face (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1310">1310</a>) favour this idea. Entrance is obtained by a doorway with a plain
pointed freestone arch, having a hood moulding close to the westmost
buttress (see Fig 1310). The church is, internally, nearly 18 feet in
width; and at the right hand, on entering, there remains the solid
foundation of a stone stair leading to a tribune or organ gallery,
recesses for the ends of massive beams to carry it being still visible,
together with rough rubble corbelling on either side.</p>

<p>On the left is a narrow doorway, neatly formed with thin schist stones,
leading to the cloisters. Internally the church is entirely devoid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_374" id="page_374">{374}</a></span>
architectural decoration, but an extensive range of stalls, of which
traces still exist, and other wood-work, including an open roof, must
have redeemed an otherwise bald interior, into which very little light
can have been admitted. The principal source of light was a 5 feet wide
window at the east end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1311">1311</a>), divided by mullions into three
lanciform lights,</p>

gable, seen on the right in Fig. <a href="#fig_1311">1311</a>, is modern, and forms the entrance

been appropriated, in recent times, as a burial-place by the proprietor
of the island. Apart from this there were only three windows in the
nave, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_375" id="page_375">{375}</a></span> very small, and another rather longer with a cusped head, all

M‘Duffies or M‘Fies, which is about 25 feet long by 12 feet wide over
the walls. These are unbonded into the south wall of the church, and
were covered with a plain lean-to roof, in which there was evidently a
priest’s apartment. The chapel is lit from the south by two small
windows, and in a recess on the north side is the burial-place of Abbot
M‘Duffie, covered with a carved slab representing the abbot fully
vested, with his right hand raised in benediction, and a pastoral staff
in his left. Pennant says:&mdash;“In the same place is a stone enriched with
foliage, a stag surrounded with dogs, and a ship with full sail; round
which is inscribed ‘Hic jacet</p>

is a singularly massive buttress, at the bottom of which, on the level
of the floor and accessible by a narrow opening from the interior of the
church, is a curious ambry about 3 feet cube, strongly lintelled
overhead, and designed, no doubt, for the safe keeping of the church
treasure, but is now desecrated as a “bone-hole.” The altar still
remains built of freestone, evidently reused from some previous
building.</p>

<p>On the north side of the chancel the arrangement is very peculiar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_377" id="page_377">{377}</a></span> An
opening about 8 feet wide, with a plain pointed freestone arch (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1312">1312</a>) resting on schist impost caps, gives access to a kind of trance or
passage, having an ambry at the ground level on the left and a blocked
up window on the right. It is formed between the north wall of the
church and the south end of the chapter house, which is gabled
independently of the church. Its only apparent use may have been as a
sacristy. It is roofed in by large flat stones, with a rapid slope to
the east. The east range of buildings is pretty complete, except on the
north, where the gable fell some years ago. On the ground floor a large
apartment, 19 feet 6 inches long by 15 feet 4 inches wide, with a
doorway entering on the east cloister walk, was no doubt the chapter
house.</p>

<p>The range of domestic buildings on the north has been sadly ruined, this
having been the point where entry was obtained, in recent times, for the
removal of materials, and thus of the north and south walls only
fragments remain. A massive wall, still happily intact, encloses the
cloister on the west. The internal area is rather over 41 feet square,
with cloister walks about 7 feet broad, and the arcading presents some
very singular features. The south arcade (Fig. <a href="#fig_1313">1313</a>), which is evidently
the most ancient, is composed of five low narrow arches with circular
heads, very neatly turned with thin schist slabs, without any freestone
or architectural dressing of any kind. The other three arcades were
evidently part of a later restoration, and the peculiar form in which
they were constructed is evidently due to the nature of the materials
employed, viz., schist slabs of the same quality as that used for the
sculptured slabs.</p>

<p>When Martin visited the island in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, the three arcades and the enclosing walls were quite complete.
A century later, in 1772, Pennant found the north arcade demolished with
the exception of the end arches, while the east and west arcades
remained intact. These subsequently disappeared also, and it was not
until 1883 that Mr. Galloway found, scattered throughout the church and
churchyard, sufficient materials to complete the restoration of one
arcade. This was accordingly done on the west side (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1313">1313</a>) in
that year. Amongst the shafts and “pillars” found there were happily
both of those mentioned by Martin as bearing inscriptions. The hewn work
of these arcades was formed entirely of the peculiar kind of schist used
in the sculptured crosses and memorial stones in the Western Highlands,
and it may have been the facility of obtaining this material in the
slab, rather than the cube form, which determined the special character
of the arcading. Each arcade had openings or arches nearly 30 inches
from centre to centre, there being seven in the east and west arcades,
and probably one or two more in the north arcade. They were built with
slab shafts, averaging 2 feet 10 inches high by 1 foot broad, and 2 or 3
inches thick, with neatly moulded and socketed caps and bases. On these<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_378" id="page_378">{378}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">there rested the slabs, shaped at each end so as to meet exactly in the
middle, thus forming a straight lined arch, and the haunches were filled
up with rubble. With this both Martin’s and Pennant’s descriptions
exactly agree.</p>

<p>The north range of the buildings, which no doubt contained the refectory
and dormitories, has been too much dilapidated to admit of any
intelligible description. In a line with it, however, and extending
eastward beyond the priory square (see Plan), there is a small chapel of
very early character, built entirely in rubble, without any freestone
dressings. It is 17 feet over the walls and 33 feet in breadth; but for
no apparent reason the west gable is slewed round to the south, making
an inequality of 2 feet in the length of the sides. There has been a
wide window in the east gable, but owing to the demolition of the wall
its character cannot be judged. There are two small windows in the north
side and one in the south, mere slits with no provisions for frames or
glazing. There is an entrance doorway on the south side at the west end
and a priest’s door at the east. On the north side there is a very small
door nearly opposite that of the entrance on the south.</p>

<p>The foundations of the altar still remain, and a line of stones still
indicates the position of the chancel rail. The base of the pulpit
remains on the north side, and at the west end there has been a tribune
or organ gallery, which has been accessible by a door in the east gable
of the priory buildings. In this gable, on the ground floor, an archway
has been formed 6 feet 8 inches in width, with a plain pointed rubble
arch, which seems to have been subsequently filled in, and a
square-headed doorway of much smaller size substituted.</p>

<p>Immediately to the north of this chapel, and separated from it by an 8
foot wide passage, is a most interesting example of a monastic barn and
byre, 39 feet in length by 22 feet in breadth. It is an excellent
specimen of rubble building with freestone dressings to the windows,
&amp;c., in the same style as the church, and may be coeval with the later
restoration. The windows are small, and on the north side close to the
ground are openings for the discharge of refuse from the byre. In the
south-east angle a small chamber has been formed for the herd, with a
little eyelet and ambry, and it would no doubt be cut off by
partitioning from the other occupants. At the south-west angle there is
a small door opening inwards, and some indications that a chamber had
been formed between the building itself and the north wall of the
priory. At the south wall head (internally) there has been inserted a 4
or 5 foot long schist slab, with a quaint human head carved in the
centre. It serves no purpose where it is, and must evidently have been a
relic of some older structure. There can be no doubt there was a doorway
to the west, but, if so, the present entrance shows no traces of it. The
building is still roofed, and in use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_381" id="page_381">{381}</a></span></p>

<p>Pennant states that the church “contains the tombs of numbers of the
ancient islanders, two of warriors recumbent (7 feet long), a flattery
perhaps of the sculptor to give to future ages exalted notions of their
prowess. Besides, there are scattered over the floor lesser figures of
heroes, priests, and females, the last seemingly of some order, and near
them is a figure cut in stone of full size, apparently an abbess.”<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>These figures, as illustrated by Pennant, strongly recall the
corresponding monuments at Iona and elsewhere throughout the West
Highlands and Islands.</p>

<p>The slabs have now been set up against the walls of the church (see Fig.
<a href="#fig_1311">1311</a>), while others still exist in the burying-ground outside.</p>

<p>Close to the south-west angle of the narthex stands the celebrated
Oronsay cross<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1310">1310</a>). It stands on mason work covered by a
slab 3 feet by 3 feet 3 inches, perforated with a hole in which the
cross is fixed. The shaft is 12 feet in height. On the west face there
is a Crucifixion on the disc, and the shaft is carved on both sides with
the usual Celtic ornament in round panels. The inscription near the base
is now illegible.</p>

<p>The site of the ancient Church of St. Maelrubba, at the head of Loch

A very interesting relic of the ancient church is, however, preserved in
the remarkable font (Figs. <a href="#fig_1314">1314</a> and <a href="#fig_1315">1315</a>), which, after some wandering
and neglect, has at last found a suitable resting-place in the Museum of
the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in Edinburgh. An account of its
transference from the shore of Loch Eynort to the Museum is given by Mr.
J. Russell Walker, in a paper on “Scottish Baptismal Fonts” in the
<i>Proceedings</i> of that Society, 1886-7, p. 412. The bowl is circular,
both externally and internally, and the basin is 1 foot 6½ inches in
diameter and 13 inches deep. The circumference is divided into four
equal parts by four figures representing&mdash;(1) The Crucifixion, (2) The
Blessed Virgin with the Child, (3) a mitred bishop in full canonicals
with a crosier in his left hand, and (4) St. Michael slaying the dragon.
The panels to the right and left of the Crucifixion are filled with
interlaced work, and those to the right and left of the bishop with
inscriptions not now legible. On the lower sloping parts between the
figures are floral designs. The font is of hornblende gneiss, and the
carving is remarkable in that hard material. There seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_382" id="page_382">{382}</a></span></p>

<p>The carving of this font is a striking illustration of the peculiar
mixture of Celtic and Gothic work, of which numerous specimens are above
noticed in connection with the structures of the Western Highlands and
Islands, as at Iona, Rowdil, &amp;c.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The examples of the third or late pointed period of Gothic architecture
given above sufficiently indicate the progress of the style during the
period, and show its gradual decline.</p>

<p>The following examples of this period, being for the most part
fragmentary, are arranged alphabetically by counties.</p>

<h2><a name="KINKELL_CHURCH_Aberdeenshire" id="KINKELL_CHURCH_Aberdeenshire"></a>KINKELL CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Aberdeenshire</span>.</h2>

<p>A ruinous building, very prettily situated on the left bank of the Don,
about three miles north from Kintore. Kinkell was once, as its name
signifies, the head church of the district, and had under it six
subordinate churches. In 1754 the Lords Commissioners for plantation of
kirks annexed one third of the parish of Kinkell to that of Kintore, the
remainder going to augment the parish of Keithhall. In 1771 the Church</p>

<p class="nind">of Kinkell was unroofed in order to supply materials for use in the
Church of Keithhall. The Church of Kinkell was remarkable for its fine
design and workmanship, and contained several monuments and sculptures;
but it is now sadly ruined, only the north wall and parts of the east
and west walls remaining.</p>

<p>The edifice (Fig. <a href="#fig_1316">1316</a>) was a simple oblong 73 feet in length by 18 feet
6 inches in width internally. There has been a large east window, only
one jamb of which partially remains, and there are no other window or
door openings preserved. The north wall seems to have been entirely
without openings. A large modern burial vault has been erected in the
centre of the church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_384" id="page_384">{384}</a></span></p>

<p>One or two features of the former fine ornamentation of the structure
still remain <i>in situ</i>, but other portions have been removed, and are
now to be found elsewhere, as will be pointed out.</p>

<p>In the north wall near the east end is a fine sacrament house (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1317">1317</a>). The design consists, as usual in these details, of a buttress on
each side of the ambry, with crocketed finials, the carving of which is
of a late style. Between the pinnacles is a panel which seems to have
been</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1317.</span>&mdash;Kinkell Church. Sacrament House.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">ornamented with the usual monstrance supported by two angels, but the
carving is nearly obliterated. Above this panel there runs a small
crenelated parapet, supported by a double row of corbels. Immediately
over the parapet is an oblong panel, which doubtless contained a
Crucifixion or similar sculpture, but it is now empty.</p>

<p>To the right and left of the pinnacles are two panels, each containing a
ribbon of different design. That on the left bears the inscription “<span class="smcap">Hic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_385" id="page_385">{385}</a></span></span>
<span class="smcap">est Svatv</span>,” and that on the right the words “<span class="smcap">Corps de Vigie Natum</span>,”
which may be read, “Hic est servatum corpus de Virgine Natum.”</p>

<p>On the base of the ambry are the letters <span class="smcap">Ano. Dni.</span> 1528, in the centre
<span class="smcap">Meorare</span>, and on the right the initials A. and G. united by a cord. The
letter G. also occurs at the end of the inscription in the right hand
panel, and is probably a repetition of the last letter of the initials
A. G.</p>

<p>Panel in North Wall of Church.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The base is supported on a continuous corbel carved with foliage, and
has in the centre a shield, bearing a lion rampant.</p>

<p>The initials A. G. twice repeated and the date, together with the late
style of the work, point to the sacrament house having been designed by
Alexander Galloway, who was rector of Kinkell in 1528, and who was also
the architect of the first bridge of ten arches over the Dee at
Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Another panel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1318">1318</a>) is built into the north wall of the church a
little to the west of the sacrament house. It contains a Crucifixion,
with a figure of the Virgin Mary on one side and an angel on the other.
The initials of Alexander Galloway occur three times on this sculpture,
and the date 1525.</p>

<p>The font which was removed from the Church of Kinkell long stood in a
garden, but is now restored and placed in St. John’s Episcopal Church,
Aberdeen. Of the original font only the granite basin now exists. It is
octagonal in form, and each face is illustrated with one or more sacred
emblems, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1319">1319</a>, except one face, on which occur the
initials of Alexander Galloway, parson of Kinkell. He was one of the
best known ecclesiastics in Scotland before the Reformation, and gifted
this font to the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_386" id="page_386">{386}</a></span> of Kinkell. Galloway appears to have been one
of the most able public men of his time, of whom Boece says,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> “He

<p>Another piece of sculpture (Fig. <a href="#fig_1320">1320</a>) said to have been removed from
the Church of Kinkell is preserved at the Church of Kintore. It was at
one time built into the outer wall of the Church of Kintore, but it has

ambry for the reception of the sacramental elements, and the upper
portion being enriched with a beautifully carved bas-relief,
representing a monstrance of elaborate tabernacle work, supported by two
angels, and crowned with a sculptured crucifix. The ambry is now
wanting, except the lintel, which bears the words Jesus Maria. Over the
lintel is a panel which no doubt formerly contained sculpture, now
removed. The whole design is surrounded with a frame composed of a
series of baluster shaped shafts, covered with flat foliage of a
Renaissance character.</p>

<p>Whether this decorated work came from Kinkell or not, it evidently
belongs to the period when that church was built, being of the latest
Gothic design, which prevailed immediately before the Reformation.</p>

<h2><a name="ST_ADAMNANS_CHAPEL_Aberdeenshire" id="ST_ADAMNANS_CHAPEL_Aberdeenshire"></a>ST. ADAMNAN’S CHAPEL, <span class="smcap">Aberdeenshire</span>.</h2>

<p>A small chapel situated near Leask, some two or three miles inland from
the old Castle of Slains. It is surrounded by what appears to have been
a churchyard, but is now covered with stunted trees. The chapel (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1321">1321</a>) is filled with its own ruins and is utterly uncared for. The walls
are fairly entire for a height of about 7 feet, while the east gable is
nearly complete, and contains a pointed window about 7 feet wide, which
was probably filled with tracery. The outside jambs are gone, but the
inner splayed face of the arch is still entire. In the east wall are the
remains of what may have been a piscina, and there is an ambry in the
south wall adjoining. There are a window in the south wall and two
openings of some kind in the north, with a narrow window high up in the
west gable. The doorway is on the south side, but its jambs are gone,
and only the bar hole remains to indicate that it was the doorway. The
church measures, externally, 45 feet from east to west by 23 feet 3
inches from north to south.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_388" id="page_388">{388}</a></span></p>

<p>Not much is recorded about this chapel. In the <i>View of the Diocese of

“dedicated to St. Fidamnan, Abbot of Icolmkill.”</p>

<p>Slight fragments of this ancient church are to be found on the north
shore of Loch Etive, about four miles from Bonawe Ferry, near Taynuilt
Station. This priory, dedicated to St. Modan, is said to have been
founded in 1231 by Duncan Mackowle or MacDougal of Lorn, for monks of
the order of Vallis Caulium. The remains (Fig. <a href="#fig_1322">1322</a>) consist of the
north, east, and west walls of what has been an oblong chamber, and
apparently</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">the choir of a church. It measures 66 feet in length by 28 feet in
width. In the small part of the south wall which survives there is a
sedilia (Fig. <a href="#fig_1323">1323</a>) with three seats. Each seat is marked by a sharply
pointed arch, and the whole are enclosed in a deeply moulded
semicircular arch. Some fragments, including a piscina, are now built
into the back of the seats, but these are modern insertions. At the
right hand termination of the large arch a small lion is sculptured,
which recalls some of the carved work at Iona, and at the bases of the
smaller arches carved leaves are introduced. There has also been an
ambry in the east wall (see Plan).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_390" id="page_390">{390}</a></span></p>

<p>At the west end of the building a double wall 9 feet in thickness has
been erected. It is pierced with a round-headed archway, and has
projecting jambs in the centre. This archway now leads into an open
courtyard connected with a mansion. Its former use is difficult to
determine.</p>

<p>To the north of the choir is preserved the outline of an irregular
structure, which may have been a sacristy. It is 42 feet long by 14 feet
wide at the east end, and 11 feet wide at the west end, and has been
connected with the choir by a doorway and two windows. The exterior
walls are now nearly demolished.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1323.</span>&mdash;Ardchattan Church. Sedilia.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To the south of the choir is an open space enclosed with a wall 18 feet
long by 15 feet wide, evidently erected as a burial-place. It has an
arched entrance gateway at the south end. On the keystone of the arch
are the letters C. K. and the date 1614. Lying within the choir are
several monuments, one being in the recess of the larger window opening
into the sacristy. Two are monuments of priors of the Macdougal family,
and bear the dates of 1500 and 1502. The inscriptions have given rise to
much discussion.</p>

<p>In 1644 the Macdonalds, led by Colkitto, burnt and destroyed the priory.</p>

<h2><a name="KILMUN_CHURCH_Argyleshire" id="KILMUN_CHURCH_Argyleshire"></a>KILMUN CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Argyleshire</span>.</h2>

<p>On the north shore of the Holy Loch, about one mile and a half from
Strone, stand the small ruins of the ancient Collegiate establishment
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_391" id="page_391">{391}</a></span> Kilmun. According to Dr. Skene a Columban establishment was here
founded by St. Fintan Munnu of Teach in Munnu in Ireland. The district
of Cowal, in which this establishment was situated, was long in the
possession of the Lamont Clan, but was subsequently acquired by the
Campbells. The church had, in the thirteenth century, passed into lay
hands, “as, between 1230 and 1246, Duncan, son of Ferchan, and his
nephew Laidman, son of Malcolm, grant to the monks of Paisley lands
which they and their ancestors had at Kilmun, with the whole right of
patronage in the church of Kilmun.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>In 1442 a collegiate establishment was founded by Duncan Campbell of
Lochow, for a provost and six prebendaries. The founder was buried</p>

<p class="nind">here in 1453, and Kilmun has since then continued to be the burial-place
of the Argyll family. The great Marquis of Argyll was interred here in
1661, and the mausoleum of the family stands in the churchyard.</p>

<p>Of the College Church only a small portion remains, a modern church
having been erected on the site of the old structure.</p>

<p>The remaining portion (Fig. <a href="#fig_1324">1324</a>) consists of a tower about 20 feet
square and about 40 feet in height. The basement floor is vaulted, and
contains a doorway which entered from the west end of the church, and
small loops in each of the south and west sides. That the church
extended eastward from the tower is apparent from the fragments of the
side walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_392" id="page_392">{392}</a></span> and the mark of the roof, which still exist on the east side
of the tower (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1325">1325</a>). A wheel stair is carried up in the
south-west angle of the tower, which gave access to three stories on the
upper floors. The first floor contained a small rectangular window to
the south. The floor above had a fireplace and a south window with
pointed and cusped arch-head</p>

<p>(Fig. <a href="#fig_1325">1325</a>). Over this was an attic, now ruined. From the above
fireplace and ornamental window, we may perhaps assume that the tower
was the abode of the provost, and from the strength with which it is
built, and general resemblance to a keep, the tower was doubtless
designed to form a place of strength in case of need.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_393" id="page_393">{393}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ALLOWAY_KIRK_Ayrshire" id="ALLOWAY_KIRK_Ayrshire"></a>ALLOWAY KIRK, <span class="smcap">Ayrshire</span>.</h2>

<p>This old structure, made famous by the genius of Burns, stands in its
churchyard, surrounded with ancient trees, on the banks of the Doon,
about three miles southwards from Ayr. The burying-ground contains many
strangely sculptured tombstones, and a plain slab marks the grave of the
poet’s father. Mention of Alloway occurs in 1236. In the beginning of
the sixteenth century, when James <small>VI.</small> refounded and enlarged the Chapel
Royal of Stirling, he annexed to it the Church of Alloway in Kyle, to
form the prebend of one of the canons of that collegiate chapel. In 1690
the parish of Alloway was annexed to that of Ayr, and the church allowed
to become ruinous.</p>

<p>The building (Fig. <a href="#fig_1326">1326</a>) is 40 feet long by 20 feet broad internally. It
is evident that the walls are ancient, but owing to alterations it is
difficult to assign the building to any definite date. The principal
feature is the two-light window (Fig. <a href="#fig_1327">1327</a>), enclosed within one arch in
the east gable, but this might be of almost any period before the
seventeenth century. The belfry is massive and by no means without good
effect, but it is clearly a post-Reformation structure.</p>

<p>On the outside of the south wall an old stoup or benitier has been let
into the wall, but what purpose it can have served is far from clear.
The church has evidently been used for worship in the seventeenth
century, but is now a roofless ruin.</p>

of last century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_394" id="page_394">{394}</a></span></p>

<p>A ruin situated in the vale of the Girvan Water, about three miles east
from Girvan. It stands in the centre of a spacious churchyard, planted
with noble trees. Within its walls rest the remains of several of the
Martyrs of the Covenant. The church was anciently called Dalmakervan,
and was dedicated to St. Michael. It was granted by Duncan, first Earl
of Carrick, to the monks of Paisley, and confirmed to them by Alexander
<small>II.</small> in 1236. It was afterwards transferred to the monks of Crosraguel,
and the name was changed to Dailly, possibly from the site of the church
having been changed.</p>

<p>The structure (Fig. <a href="#fig_1328">1328</a>) is very long and narrow, being 92 feet in
length and 26 feet wide over the walls. There is a gable wall at each
end, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_395" id="page_395">{395}</a></span> each gable is crowned with a belfry (Fig. <a href="#fig_1329">1329</a>). It is

<p>A burial vault has been constructed within the east part of the
building, in connection with the Bargeny Estate, which adjoins. Another
similar vault for the use of the Killochan Estate, situated on the
opposite side of the Girvan Water, has been erected at the north-east
angle of the church (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1329">1329</a>). It is evidently a seventeenth
century structure. The north front is peculiar, having a deep niche on

<p>The existing church is plain and of post-Reformation date, except a wing
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1330">1330</a>) which extends like a transept to the south, and measures
about 21 feet 3 inches each way. This wing has been built in Gothic
times, and when first erected probably formed part of the church, having

of the Blairquhan family, whose domain adjoins. This upper floor is
entered by a stair which has been erected on the south side of the wing
(but is omitted in the sketch).</p>

<p>The south wing or transept contains, besides the large east window above
referred to, a doorway (Fig. <a href="#fig_1331">1331</a>) in the north-west angle, with an ogee
shaped arch, surmounted by a panel having a pointed and trefoiled
arch-head, and an enriched moulding surrounding the jambs and arch.</p>

<p>These features all indicate a late date. The large window in the south
gable is of handsome form and construction, and the tracery is well
designed and executed. It would naturally be assigned to the fourteenth
century, but for the lower members, which are formed with straight
lines, and certainly point to a later period, probably the sixteenth
century. This window thus shows the tendency there was in Scotland to
revert at the latter date to the forms of an earlier period.</p>

<p>The mode of finishing the gable also indicates a late time. Large gabled
crowsteps, such as are seen here, are rare features in ecclesiastical
edifices in this country. We do not recall any example of such large
crowsteps, except at Methven Church, Perthshire, which is undoubtedly a
late example.</p>

<p>The Church of Straiton was dedicated to St. Cuthbert, and granted, by
Alexander <small>II.</small> in 1236, to the monks of Paisley, but afterwards
transferred to Crosraguel Abbey.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_398" id="page_398">{398}</a></span></p>

<p>The ancient town of Cullen stood on the right bank of Cullen Water, at a

Montrose, and has been rebuilt on a new site nearer the sea. The old

<p class="nind">by the churchyard, on the old site near Cullen House, and continues to
be used as the Parish Church. Although it has been altered at different
times it still retains part of the ancient work, the oldest portions
being the east end and the south aisle. The edifice (Fig. <a href="#fig_1332">1332</a>) is
cruciform in plan, having nave, choir, and transepts, all without
aisles. The choir would appear, from the coats of arms it bears on the
outside, and from the splendid monument in the interior of the north
wall, to have been erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_399" id="page_399">{399}</a></span> by Alexander Ogilvie, who died in 1554, and
his second wife, Elizabeth Gordon.</p>

<p>There was a chaplainry in the church dedicated to St. Ann. This
foundation, with the name of the founder and other particulars, are
recorded by inscriptions cut upon different parts of the south aisle or
transept.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> “The first quoted inscription is from the arch of a
recess tomb on the west side of the aisle. It is carved in raised and
prettily formed capitals, and accompanied by a craftsman’s mark.</p>

<p>The places named in the above inscription were received by Alexander
Seton of Gordon (first Earl of Huntly) through his marriage with the
heiress of Sir John Hay of Tilibody. “It was probably John’s son, David
Hay, who, about 1390-1406, had a charter from Robert <small>III.</small> of the place
of Cullen.”</p>

<p>“The next quoted inscription not only presents the important and
interesting facts of the name of the chaplainry, the extent of the gift,
and the services required, but also the names of the founder of the
chaplainry and the persons to be prayed for, together with those in whom
the patronage of the living was to be vested after the decease of the
heirs of the donor. It is carved round the arch of the large window of
the south aisle, in the same style as the above inscription.</p>

<p>The words <small>PER · ELENA · HAY</small> are carved upon the lower side of one of the
stones of the arch of the south window. Upon the west side of the arch
is this notice of the building of the aisle:&mdash;</p>

<p>“· · · <small>ELENGE · HAY · IŌN · DUFFIS · MODR · OF · MALDAVAT · YAT · MAID
YIS · ISLE · YE · CHAPLANRI.</small> · · ·”</p>

<p>The two inscriptions last quoted “show that Elen Hay was mother of John
Hay of Muldavit, who died in 1404, to whom, until 1792, there was a
recumbent effigy in the recess tomb in the south aisle at Cullen, also
an inscribed slab with a rudely engraved figure in armour.”</p>

<p>The entrance to St. Ann’s Chapel from the main church is by an arch with

<p class="nind">of it, together with the style of the mottoes, would rather tend to the
conclusion that the work is of a considerably later date. The arch
forming the entrance from the church to the chapel, with its pilasters,
has certainly the character of sixteenth century work. The group of four
pointed windows in the south end of the south aisle has not the
appearance of decorated work, such as prevailed about 1404. On the
contrary, these windows recall the revived and imitative work of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This group of windows, with its
four pointed lights (round the inside of which one of the above
inscriptions occurs), is evidently a late design. Possibly an aisle was
built in the beginning of the fifteenth century, when the bequest was
made, but it seems to have been rebuilt in the following century, when
the inscriptions, which are scattered very irregularly over the
structure, were reinserted and added to. The edifice was probably
rebuilt when, about 1543, the Church of Cullen was converted into a
college by Alexander Ogilvie of Deskford and Findlater, for the
accommodation and maintenance of a provost, six prebendaries, and two
singing boys. A bead-house was also erected by the same individual, for
the support of a number of decayed men and women.</p>

<p>The choir, which is a portion added at the east end, contains a richly
decorated monument in the north wall, erected by Alexander Ogilvie at
the date of the church being made collegiate. The monument (Fig. <a href="#fig_1334">1334</a>)
is large, and extends from the floor to the roof. It consists of an
arched<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_403" id="page_403">{403}</a></span> recess with a group of ornamental shafts at each side, and large
spandrils above, containing two large round panels, each having in the
centre a sculptured figure in bas-relief. Along the top runs a series of
canopies</p>

<p class="nind">and pinnacles of peculiar design. Within the arch lies an effigy of the
founder clad in armour, supported on a basement, which is divided into
eight panels, each containing a figure attired in a hood and long robe<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_404" id="page_404">{404}</a></span>
with book in hand. On a slab at the back of the arched recess is carved
the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>The inscription is accompanied by a variety of curious carvings, and by
the Ogilvie and Gordon arms. The style of the monument corresponds with
the date upon it, being one of the last attempts in the style of Gothic
work executed just before the Reformation.</p>

<p>Mr Jervise mentions that in 1863, when alterations were made on the east
portion of the church, a stone altar-piece and ambry, in fine
preservation, were found. These were 5 to 6 feet in height, embellished<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_405" id="page_405">{405}</a></span>
with the representation of two angels raising the host and other
ornaments, and the text (John vi. 54-56) below the cornice.</p>

</div>

<p>It is further stated that the ambry and altar-piece were unfortunately
reconsigned from view. A sacrament house, answering somewhat to the
above description of the ambry, is, however, now visible in the north
wall of the choir, to the east of the monument (Fig. <a href="#fig_1335">1335</a>). The design
shows the two angels supporting a monstrance, and is very similar to,
but much simpler than, the sacrament house at Deskford, “which bears to
have been erected by Alexander Ogilvie, and his second wife, Elizabeth
Gordon,” of which an illustration is given below.</p>

<p>The east end of the church has evidently been a good deal altered, as is
apparent from the south wall (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1333">1333</a>), where doorways are
visible, which have been built up, and windows introduced above.</p>

<p>The coats of arms of the Gordons and Ogilvies on the exterior correspond
with those in the interior. The choir contains a large east window
divided by three mullions, which cross one another in curved branches,
forming plain tracery in the arch-head (Fig. <a href="#fig_1336">1336</a>).</p>

<p>On the south side of the choir is still preserved a fine example of a
laird’s pew (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1336">1336</a>). It is in two stories, the upper story
(which forms a gallery) being supported on four solid square wooden
pillars (Figs. <a href="#fig_1337">1337</a>, <a href="#fig_1338">1338</a>, and <a href="#fig_1339">1339</a>), which are well carved with
numerous ornaments of Renaissance work, and bear the date of 1608. The
upper portion or gallery is also old, and contains some good carved
woodwork of the post-Reformation period. It is still used as the
proprietor’s pew, and is occupied by the Earl of Seafield, whose mansion
of Cullen House is close to the church. The lower story is occupied by
ordinary pews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_406" id="page_406">{406}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="DESKFORD_CHURCH_Banffshire" id="DESKFORD_CHURCH_Banffshire"></a>DESKFORD CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Banffshire</span>.</h2>

<p>The old church of Deskford is situated in its ancient churchyard, about
four miles south from Cullen. The church is now a roofless ruin, a new
church having been erected in the vicinity. The building is a plain
parallelogram, and has no features of note, except the large sacrament
house in the north wall near the east end. It seems to have been the
fashion in the sixteenth century in this part of the country to make
these features very ornamental. Such are the ambries or sacrament houses
at Kinkell, Auchendoir, and Cullen. The last was erected by the same
individual to whom that at Deskford is attributed, viz., Alexander
Ogilvie of Deskford and Findlater, whose splendid monument exists in
Cullen Church (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1334">1334</a>).</p>

<p>The sacrament house at Deskford (Fig. <a href="#fig_1340">1340</a>) is very large, being 8 feet
in height by 3 feet 6 inches wide. The design is somewhat similar in all
the above sacrament houses, consisting of two angels above the ambry
supporting a monstrance, with a quasi-buttress on each side, and several
inscriptions and enrichments. At Deskford the side buttresses are a good
deal broken and their pinnacles removed. The whole design is surrounded
with a scroll ornament of grapes, and there are several inscriptions on
various parts of the design. The first is on two scrolls immediately
over the ambry, “Os meum es et cara mea”&mdash;“Thou art my bone and my
flesh;” and another occurs on the broad sill of the ambry, “Ego sum
panis vivus qui de celo descendi quis manducaverit ex hoc pane vivet in
æternum”&mdash;from sixth chapter of John’s Gospel. Beneath the latter are
two shields, the first containing the arms of Ogilvie of Deskford and
Findlater, viz., 1st and 4th a lion passant gardant gules for Ogilvie,
2nd and 3rd argent a cross engrailed sable for Sinclair of Deskford,
with motto Tout jour. The initials A. O. occur at the sides of this
shield. The second shield contains, impaled with the above, the arms of
Gordon, for Alexander Ogilvie’s second wife, Elizabeth Gordon, and the
motto Laus Deo.</p>

<p>Under the coats of arms there is a long inscription, which is remarkable
as being the only one in English on any of the above sacrament houses.
It also authorises the name of sacrament house for these ornamental
ambries. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><small>THIS · PN̄T</small> (present) <small>LOVEBLE · VARK · OF · SACRAMĒT · HOVS · MAID · TO

<p>The date would lead one to expect the very debased Gothic work which is
found here, the influence of the approaching Renaissance being very
apparent in the style of the ornamentation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_407" id="page_407">{407}</a></span></p>

<p>It was formerly believed, on the evidence of Boece, that Malcolm ii. in
a battle with the Danes, looking up to the Chapel of St. Moloc at
Mortlach, vowed that, if successful, he would there erect a cathedral

support this statement, and mentioned further that the see was
afterwards transferred by David i. to Aberdeen. But Professor Cosmo
Innes has</p>

<p class="nind">proved that these stories are forgeries, and must be entirely rejected.
It is, however, probable that there was an early religious settlement at
Mortlach, which may have given some foundation for the above fables. At
all events, in 1157, a Bull of Pope Adrian <small>IV.</small> mentions the monastery of
Mortlach and the five churches belonging to it.</p>

<p>The existing structure (Fig. <a href="#fig_1341">1341</a>) consists of an old building of simple
oblong form, 83 feet in length internally by 24 feet in width, to which
was added, in 1826, a large north wing or aisle. This wing was further
vefynded in 1876, and now measures, internally, 36 feet long by 26 feet.</p>

<p>A small wing or projection has also been added to the south to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_409" id="page_409">{409}</a></span> contain
an organ, and the whole church has been reseated and fitted up for
service in modern style. There are two lancet windows in the east end,
which, together with some portions of the walls, may be ancient (perhaps
of thirteenth century date), as it is understood that these windows were
found built up, and were reopened during the late restoration, but the
remainder of the church has been completely modernised.</p>

appears to have been a dog lying at her feet, but it has been knocked

<p>About a quarter of a mile to the south of the church, on the slope of a
hill, there are the foundations of a chapel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1345">1345</a>) measuring about
38 feet long by 15 feet wide internally. The end walls are each about 5
feet thick, and the side walls about 3 feet. Nothing else belonging to
the church remains, except a few fragments of what was probably a
circular font, and a window sill lying amongst the ruins. It shows that
the window was eight inches wide. A plain slab 6 feet long by 18 inches
wide lies in the centre of the building.</p>

oblong, measuring 54 feet 6 inches in length by about 20 feet in width
externally. The doorway is in the south side, and has been provided with
a slot for a bolt. The remains of a stoup and ambry exist beside the

<p>The old church of Bassendean is still used as a burial-place by the
Homes of Bassendean.</p>

<p>The church belonged to the priory of Coldstream, and appears to have
been abandoned at the Reformation. It was again used for divine service
from 1647 to 1649, when a new church was erected at Westruther, and St.

<h2><a name="COCKBURNSPATH_CHURCH_Berwickshire" id="COCKBURNSPATH_CHURCH_Berwickshire"></a>COCKBURNSPATH CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Berwickshire</span>.</h2>

<p>The village of Cockburnspath is situated about seven miles south-east of
Dunbar. The church here is peculiar and unique, in having a round tower
in the centre of the west wall. It is a long narrow building (Fig.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_414" id="page_414">{414}</a></span>
1349), measuring about 80 feet in length by 18 feet 3 inches in width.
The structure has been much knocked about, having undergone at least two
restorations at different times, the last being about twenty years ago.
It is therefore not surprising to find that there is nothing left inside
the building of any architectural interest. Four angle buttresses at the
corners, however, remain intact, together with portions of an early base
course near the east end, and the head of a window, containing
geometrical tracery (Fig. <a href="#fig_1350">1350</a>), has been preserved and built into the
south wall over the door near the east end. Judging from these details
and from the thickness of the walls (3 feet 2 inches) it seems probable
that the church is not later than the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The tower (Fig. <a href="#fig_1351">1351</a>) is about 9 feet in external diameter, and its
interior diameter is about 6 feet. It is about 30 feet high, and
contains</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1349.</span>&mdash;Cockburnspath Church. Plan.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">a circular stone stair. There is a string course above the level of the
ridge of the church, above which the tower rises one story. In this
there are several openings or loop holes of a roughly formed cross
shape, similar to those sometimes found in the old castles. The tower is
built of rubble work in quite a different style of masonry from that of
the church. There is nothing to indicate that it is older than the
church, except its position. Mr. T. S. Robertson<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> is probably
correct when he states, “From its position, I am clearly of opinion that
it existed before the church, and that the church walls were built up to
it. I cannot believe that any one capable of building the round tower
would have taken out the centre of a gable fully 3 feet thick to insert
this tower,” for it will be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_415" id="page_415">{415}</a></span> that the tower projects inside.
“The most that would have been done, had the church been earlier than
the tower, would have been to slap a door of communication through the
wall of the church.” The tower was probably erected independently as a
belfry and for other occasional purposes. A circular stair beginning at
the level of the church floor, and entering from the church by a
square-headed door, is carried up as far as the upper story of the
tower, which has been mended with brick work, otherwise the tower is all
of one age. The walls are only 18 inches thick, but the</p>

<p class="nind">stone steps of the stair bind them together, and make the building as
strong as if it had been built of one solid mass of masonry.</p>

<p>The small building at the east end is probably a century later than the
church. It has a pointed barrel-vaulted roof, and an original
square-headed doorway in the centre of its east wall. It is now used as
the heating chamber of the church.</p>

<p>On the apex of the south-west buttress there is a remarkable sundial,
which has already been illustrated.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_416" id="page_416">{416}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="PRESTON_CHURCH_Berwickshire" id="PRESTON_CHURCH_Berwickshire"></a>PRESTON CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Berwickshire</span>.</h2>

<p>A ruined church situated about two miles north from Duns. It is in a
state of complete dilapidation, and is densely covered with ivy. The
structure (Fig. <a href="#fig_1352">1352</a>) consists of a nave and chancel of equal width, the
whole internal length being about 70 feet by 14 feet 6 inches in width,
and the chancel is about 18 feet 6 inches long. The round chancel arch
is blocked, and it is doubtful if it is original. There are two narrow
pointed windows in the east wall and one in the west wall, all widely
splayed towards the interior, and finished with a segmental arch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_417" id="page_417">{417}</a></span>
Another window in the south wall of the chancel (shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1353">1353</a>) is
of the same character, only that it is lintelled on the inside instead</p>

<p>17 inches from the wall (Fig. <a href="#fig_1354">1354</a>) and having a shallow basin supported
on a rounded base. Above the shelf there is a round-arched recess 2 feet
2 inches high by 18 inches wide. The back of this recess leans forward,
so that while it is 8½ inches deep at the base, it is only 3 inches at
the crown of the arch.</p>

<p>There are two south doors with square lintels, one in the chancel and
another in the nave near the west end. A later door has been made at the
east end of the nave.</p>

<p>All the doors and windows are finished on the outside with a simple
chamfer.</p>

<p class="nind">in the end walls and the shallow buttresses at the west end have an
early appearance, but the same cannot be said of the details shown in

antiquity.” This church, with that of Bunkle, about two miles distant,
belonged to the Bishopric of Dunkeld.</p>

<p>About half a mile westwards from the town of Rothesay, and approached by
an avenue of fine old trees, there stands in the ancient burial-ground
the choir of the Abbey Church of St. Mary. The west end has been built
up with a wall containing a wide gateway, but otherwise the chancel
remains in fair preservation, although roofless. A modern church has
been erected beside it, but with an interval of a few inches between the
new and old structures.</p>

<p>The ancient chancel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1355">1355</a>) now measures 27 feet in length by 18
feet in width internally. The east wall, with its gable (Fig. <a href="#fig_1356">1356</a>),
still survives, and contains a large three-light window, of which the
tracery has been of the simple intersecting kind. The east ends of the
side walls had each a single pointed light with pointed rear arches.
Near the west end of the north wall is a plain pointed doorway, and a
small window with square lintel. The west end of the south wall
contained a doorway, now built up.</p>

<p>Opposite one another, in the centre of the north and south walls, are
erected two more than usually interesting monuments. Both are recessed
in the wall, and are covered with an arched canopy, and in each the
effigy of the person commemorated is preserved. The monument in the
south wall (Fig. <a href="#fig_1357">1357</a>) is the larger and finer of the two. It measures
nearly 11 feet over the side buttresses. The ogee arch in which it is
enclosed contains bold, but late, mouldings. The arch has been
ornamented with large crockets, but they are now much wasted away. The
monument has doubtless been erected in memory of one of the Stewarts of
Bute, who buried here, but its heraldry is peculiar. At the apex there
is a shield, which appears to contain the royal arms, but has two lions
for supporters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_419" id="page_419">{419}</a></span> instead of the usual unicorns. There is also on the
base or pedestal of the monument a coat of arms, containing quarterly
first and fourth the Stewart arms, and second and third the royal arms.
The shield is supported by two angels. In a paper by Mr. John
Mackinlay,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> written in 1825, these arms are fully described and
illustrated. They were then doubtless better preserved than they now
are, but the arms can still be deciphered. Mr. Mackinlay tries to
explain the remarkable circumstance of the Stewart arms having
precedence in the lower shield over the royal arms, by supposing that
they are placed on the tomb of the chief of the</p>

discovered.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> As the bearings in quartered shields are often reversed
by mistake, the same may have happened here.</p>

<p>The effigy is that of a knight in complete plate armour. The head rests
on a tilting helmet, with a dog’s head for crest, which is attached to a
cap put on over the helmet. The round hollow visible to the spectator
represents the inside of the helmet. The feet rest upon a lion. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_420" id="page_420">{420}</a></span>
figure is considerably worn, but the plate armour and the gauntlets are
still distinctly seen. The bottom of the shirt of mail worn under the
cuirass and the jewelled sword belt and hilt of the sword are also
clearly visible. A coat of arms, similar to that on the pedestal, is
carved on the breast, being intended to represent the arms wrought in
embroidery on the surcoat.</p>

<p>The lower part of the monument has been divided into panels, each
containing a quatrefoil, and between the panels there were at one time
small</p>

wrote, one of these figures survived; now they are all gone, together
with parts of the quatrefoils, and an irregular empty space is left
where they once stood. Mr. Mackinlay mentions that some excavation was
made, and an arched recess was found under the monument in which the
coffins had been placed, and three skulls were discovered therein. In
the upper part of the monument over the arch are two recesses, which
probably at one time contained coats of arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_421" id="page_421">{421}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">figures of the lady and child are cut in a thin slab of stone, and have
not the bold effect of the knight in armour. There are no arms or
inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_423" id="page_423">{423}</a></span> on this monument, and the name of the person commemorated
is unknown. The arch over the figures is of the same description as that
of the opposite monument, but it is lower and not so effective. The
mouldings are also similar, and there have been crockets over the arch,
which are now greatly decayed. The width of the monument over all is
fully 8 feet.</p>

<p>The lower part of the monument on which the effigies rest is divided
into eight panels by shafts, and each panel contains a sculptured
figure. Mr. Mackinlay says that they represent saints, and that amongst
them is the Virgin and Child. In their decayed condition the latter is
not now recognisable. The figures seem rather to resemble persons in the
dress of the fifteenth century, and some of them appear to be kneeling.</p>

<p>At the east end of the chancel there is a pointed piscina in the south
wall (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1357">1357</a>) and an ambry in the east wall.</p>

<p>The style of the structure and of the monuments is undoubtedly late,
probably sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The town of Dumbarton is situated on the left bank of the river Leven,
near its junction with the Clyde, and not far from the detached rock on
which stands the Castle of Dumbarton. A church existed here from a very
early time, and the parish church appears to have been rebuilt at least
three times, and is now a modern edifice of 1811. Previously the parish
church was represented by the quaint structure shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1359">1359</a>, which
has entirely disappeared, along with the hospital or bead-house
adjacent, which was erected in 1636 by Buchanan of Auchmore, and endowed
by him with £1021. This view is copied from a pencil sketch made by Paul
Sandby in 1747, which forms part of a valuable collection of sketches
relating to Scotland, preserved in the Library of the Royal Scottish
Academy, to the Council of which we are indebted for permission to
reproduce it.</p>

<p>The parish church (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1359">1359</a>) was probably intended to consist of a
choir and nave with a central tower, but only the choir and tower would
seem to have been built. As frequently happened, a north aisle or
transept appears from the view to have existed. This contained what was
known in later times as Mr. Campbell of Stonefield’s gallery and the
town council gallery, and it was entered by an outside stair. From the
description of the interior in Glen’s <i>History of Dumbarton</i>, p. 74, the
church was evidently a typical specimen of those picturesque, though
plain, interiors which have now almost disappeared. The pulpit stood on
the south side, and there were various galleries for the trades and for

convenient seat, was granted liberty by the kirk-session “to build ane

and was presumably covered with lead. Shortly after this sketch was made

1758, they were entirely demolished by the magistrates, and the stones
used to build the East Bridge and for other purposes. The church appears
to have been used as the parish church till about 1810, when it was
taken down and a new church built on the site.</p>

<p>The Collegiate Church and Hospital of St. Mary were founded in 1450 by
Lady Isabella, Duchess of Albany and Countess of Lennox. She was the
widow of Murdoch, Duke of Albany, who was beheaded at Stirling in 1425.
About the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Earl of Lennox gifted
the church, with the temporality, to the Abbey of Kilwinning. The
chapter consisted of a provost and six canons, and was endowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_426" id="page_426">{426}</a></span> the
parish churches of Bonhill, Fintry, and Strathblane, and also held
considerable lands in the neighbourhood of Dumbarton, which yielded to
Kilwinning at the Reformation an annual revenue of £66, 13s. 4d.
sterling.</p>

<p>The founder erected the college for the repose of the souls of “her
dearest husband, her father, and her sons,” who had been slain by their
relative James I. of Scotland, under the belief that they had been to
blame in connection with his long imprisonment in England.</p>

<p>After the Reformation the college was allowed to fall into ruin, and its
materials were gradually carried off. In 1858, in order to make room for
the railway station, the last remnants of the edifice, one of the pier
arches and its piers (Fig. <a href="#fig_1360">1360</a>) were removed from their position on a
grassy knoll, from which a fine view of the Leven was visible, and
re-erected as the gateway of a house.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>This structure is an interesting example of a private ecclesiastical
foundation. The remains of the chapel stand in an ancient churchyard, on
a knoll close to a small stream, about one and a half miles north-west
from Cardross Railway Station. The building has attached to it the piece
of land with which it was endowed, and is surrounded by the estate of
Kilmahew, the property of John William Burns, Esq., to whom we are
indebted for bringing the structure under our notice.</p>

<p>This chapel is believed to have been erected for the convenience of the
inhabitants of the locality, owing to the great distance of their parish
church at Roseneath, and also of the church of the neighbouring parish
of Cardross. The Napiers were proprietors of Kilmahew from about 1300.
John Napier was one of the defenders of Stirling Castle in 1304, along
with Sir William Olyfard. In 1406 William Napier obtained a charter of
the half lands of Kilmahew, “where the chapel is situated.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>A chapel existed here in 1370, when a charter was granted to Roger
Cochran of the lands of Kilmahew, “with the chapel thereof.” In 1467 a
new chapel was erected by Duncan Napier, then proprietor of Kilmahew,
who endowed it with an annual rent of 40s. and 10d. out of tenements in
Dumbarton. In the above year the new chapel, dedicated to St. Mahew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_427" id="page_427">{427}</a></span>
was consecrated by George, Bishop of Argyll, in mitre and full
pontificals, with the permission of the Bishop of Glasgow, in whose
diocese it was situated. Possibly the existing chancel is part of the
structure then dedicated.</p>

<p>At the Reformation this chapel was used as a preaching station by a
reader under the minister of Roseneath, but when the site of Cardross
Church was altered so as to bring it into its present more convenient
position as regards this locality, the chapel fell into disuse. The
burying-ground attached to it, however, continued in use for interments
till recent years. In 1640 a portion of the chapel was turned into a
school, in terms of an agreement between Robert Napier of Kilmahew and
the other heritors. Under this agreement Kilmahew bound himself&mdash;first,
“to give the use of his chapel of Kilmahew bewest the quir thereof, for

ancient, but the latter appears to be comparatively modern. The choir

3 inches in width from north to south, and the walls are 3 feet in

there is an arched recess 8 feet in length by 2 feet in depth, which may

<p>On a hill on the opposite side of the River Annan from the town of

<p>The building is believed to have been originally erected by the Knights

now remains of the structure is a portion of what appears to have been
the west wall, containing parts of a pointed window (Fig. <a href="#fig_1371">1371</a>), which
has been divided into three lights by two mullions, one of which, and
one arch and half of another, only remain. The three lights had sharply
pointed openings, and the principal arch had two splays on its ingoing.
The design might belong to almost any period of Gothic, but the form
adopted was common in late work.</p>

<p class="nind">corner. The dimensions of the building were ascertained to be about 96
feet from east to west by about 30 feet 6 inches from north to south
over the walls. The angle buttresses shown at the east end are
conjectural, and are based on a tradition that the corners of the
existing church were copied from the form of the east end of the old
church.</p>

<p>Mr. Schultz states that an old burial list, of which the date is
uncertain, but which may be of the seventeenth or early eighteenth
century, alludes to certain graves which can still be recognised as so
many feet from the “queer pillar” (buttress), <i>i.e.</i>, the buttress
opposite which the chancel arch is represented. Mr. Schultz assumes from
this that the choir or “queer” extended as far as this buttress; and the
fact that a splayed base was found all along the choir wall as far as
this point, and that no such splay existed farther west, gives a certain
sanction to the above view, as does also the circumstance that the nave
or western part of the building had no buttresses. It is frequently
found that the eastern end was treated in a different manner from the
west end. A foundation was found inside the building, at a distance of
about 6 feet from the east wall, and it is conjectured that this may
represent the seat of an altar. The windows, of which several stones
were found, appear to have had single mullions with simple pointed
arches.</p>

<p>Although only demolished in this century, there does not appear to be
any view of the old church known. It is described by Symson, in his
<i>Large Description of Galloway</i>, “as a considerable and large fabrick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_436" id="page_436">{436}</a></span>

but as it is a building of considerable importance, it is introduced
here in order to illustrate some points not formerly brought out. The
edifice is a long parallelogram, with central avenue and north and south
aisles, and is fairly entire along its whole length, except the outer
wall of the north aisle. It has a lofty pele-like tower quite entire at
the west end of the south aisle (Fig. <a href="#fig_1376">1376</a>), which enters from the
interior of the church by a doorway about 10 feet above the floor.</p>

<p>The tower is strong and quite capable of resisting a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_438" id="page_438">{438}</a></span>

<p>A small ruin consisting of three arches of an old church, which stood on
the ancient site before the present modern structure was erected in the
immediate vicinity. The village of Kilconquhar is situated on a large
loch about one mile and a half north-west from Elie.</p>

<p>The name is derived from the ancient Saint Connacher. There is little of
the history of the church preserved. It was granted in 1200 by Duncan,
Earl of Fife, to the Convent of North Berwick, and in 1266, after a

<p>The three arches (Fig. <a href="#fig_1381">1381</a>) are all that now survive of the old
church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_442" id="page_442">{442}</a></span> They probably formed the arcade between the centre and side
aisle, but there is nothing to show how the rest of the building was
placed with reference to them. The north wall of the enclosure of a
burying-place (shown by dotted lines in Fig. <a href="#fig_1382">1382</a>) has an ancient look,
and may be part of the old church.</p>

<p>The arches have plain splays. The round pillars have caps formed by a
single hollow without any necking, and the bases are formed with a
splay. Both caps and bases follow the curve of the pillars. They
indicate a structure of very late date, probably about the time of the
Reformation.</p>

<p>The village and church of Kilrenny stand about one mile inland from the
coast at Anstruther. The only record before the Reformation is that in
1268 a pension was given to the vicar, who in 1336 was a certain
“John.”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> The tower of the church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1383">1383</a>) is old, and is attached

castles of the period. There are traces of a large arch in the east wall
of the tower, and another in the south wall, as if intended to open into
a building, possibly the old church. The mark of the roof over the
building on the south side still remains, and also a portion of a thick
wall running southwards from the tower. In the internal angles of the
tower there are square shafts with rude caps, apparently intended to
support a vault, but there are now no traces of any vaulting. There are
also the remains of a two-light window in the north wall of the tower.
Attached to the west end of the tower is a stately monument erected by
the family of Lumsdaine of Innergelly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_443" id="page_443">{443}</a></span></p>

north wall. The east end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1386">1386</a>) contains two narrow pointed windows
with a simple moulding on the outside, which is returned round the sill.
The moulding (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1386">1386</a>) is rebated on the exterior for a shutter.
The ingoings are widely splayed and have pointed rear arches. The
ancient part of the north wall is built with ashlar work, the stones
being of a cubic form, resembling Norman work, and the mortar is well
washed out of the joints. The remainder of the north wall is built with
irregular courses, and the wall opening has a straight lintel. There is
an ambry in the north wall near the east end, and a recess in the wall
near the doorway. The church has been 15 feet wide internally, and
probably about 50 feet in length.</p>

<p>Amongst the many remains of religious establishments still visible in
this old ecclesiastical centre, the ruins of a small part of the Church
of the Blackfriars are prominent from their situation, being an ivy clad
fragment of the church which stands detached in the grounds of the
Madras College, and forms a conspicuous object close to South Street,
one of the leading thoroughfares of the town.</p>

<p>The Dominicans or Friars preachers were introduced into Scotland in 1231
by Bishop Clement of Dunblane, and they were encouraged by Alexander
<small>II.</small>, who founded eight houses of the order in the principal towns of
Scotland. This order was brought to St. Andrews by Bishop William
Wishart, well known from the great works carried out by him at the
cathedral.</p>

<p>Bishop Elphinstone, the distinguished prelate of Aberdeen and founder of
the University in that city, died in 1514, leaving a sum of £10,000,
part of which Prior Hepburn of St. Andrews succeeded in obtaining from
the executor, Sir Thomas Myrton, Archdeacon of Aberdeen, for the purpose
of rebuilding the convent of the Friars preachers in St. Andrews. In
connection with this arrangement, the provincial of the order, John
Adamson, a great reformer, held a chapter at Stirling in 1519, in which
the revenues of the convent at Cupar and part of those of St. Monans
were transferred to St. Andrews, while these convents were
suppressed.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>No record is preserved of the buildings erected at this time, but
probably the church was rebuilt and a series of domestic structures
erected round a quadrangle on the south side of the church. The
monastery was attacked and pillaged by the mob in 1560. The possessions
of the convent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_446" id="page_446">{446}</a></span> had been gradually disposed of in the beginning of the
sixteenth century, and after the Reformation the monastery was
abandoned, and the buildings gradually fell to pieces, the materials
being carried off in the usual manner.</p>

<p>The only portion now surviving is an apsidal wing or chapel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1387">1387</a>)
which projected from the north side of the church. It is 26 feet long by
21 feet in width internally. The three-sided form of the north end is
not uncommon in the sixteenth century in Scotland, but it is not usually
adopted in side chapels or transepts, being generally reserved for the
east end of the chancel. At Ladykirk, Berwickshire, however, we have an
example of the three-sided apse introduced in the chancel, and also</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">in the north and south transepts. There is a window in each of the three
sides of the apse (Fig. <a href="#fig_1388">1388</a>), the central one containing four lights
and the diagonal windows three lights. A large window in the west wall
has also four lights. The tracery in the windows has been renewed in
modern times in a somewhat imperfect manner. The buttresses on the
exterior angles have been almost entirely carried away. The altar
probably stood on the east side, where there is an ambry, with the
arch-head carved with a debased form of tracery. There seems to have
been a doorway in the east wall, now built up.</p>

<p>The vaulting of the chapel (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1388">1388</a>) is partly preserved. That
over the square portion is a pointed barrel vault with ribs, arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_447" id="page_447">{447}</a></span>
in sexpartite form. The ribs spring from corbels and small shafts. One
of the corbels is carved with the Hepburn arms. The central boss of the
vault bears the heart surrounded with two hands and feet,</p>

<p class="nind">emblems of the Passion. The vault of the apse is broken away, but it has
been divided into three panels by ribs rising to a point at the apex.
The vaulting of the main part of the chapel is of plain barrel form,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_448" id="page_448">{448}</a></span> the cross ribs are introduced as ornaments on the surface, a common
arrangement in late work. The ribs of the apse spring from two vaulting
shafts rising from corbels, the caps of which have shields bearing the
Hepburn arms (on a chevron a rose between two lions rampant). The
chevron is still distinguishable. From the threefold repetition of these
arms, it is supposed that this chapel was erected by Prior Hepburn, as a
memorial and, perhaps, a burial chapel. The responds at the entrance,
with their caps and other details, are of the third pointed period, and
correspond with the date when the chapel was erected. A row of plain
corbels, visible over the main arch, doubtless supported the roof of the
principal nave of the church.</p>

<p>This college was founded by John Hepburn, Prior of St. Andrews, in
conjunction with Archbishop Alexander Stewart. It remained under the
authority of the prior and chapter, and was designed for the education
of twenty-four poor students. The college, however, soon became famed
for its learning, and was attended by sons of the nobility. The students
were specially instructed in music, and helped to spread a knowledge of
sacred music throughout the country. George Buchanan, the well-known
scholar, was at one time Principal.</p>

<p>The chapel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1389">1389</a>) is a simple oblong chamber, being, internally,
about 80 feet in length by 20 feet 6 inches in width, and has no
division between chancel and nave. The design of the windows and
buttresses (Fig. <a href="#fig_1390">1390</a>) accords well with the date of erection in the
sixteenth century, being in the perpendicular style, such as is common
in the colleges in England. The windows are all square-headed, and the
three-light ones have the heads of the lights cusped like quatrefoils.
The church appears, from the marks in the walls, to have been extended
24 feet at the east end, probably at the time when it was converted into
the college.</p>

<p>On the north side of the church is a room with a round barrel vault,
probably the sacristy. From the door of the sacristy a narrow passage
runs along the east end of the church in the thickness of the wall, and
from it there are two loops into the church. Above this passage, and
also in the thickness of the wall, another narrow passage is constructed
in the east wall, which is continued round in the north wall as far as
the vault of the sacristy extends. There is a shallow piscina in the
east window sill. The west end has a door in the centre, and three
remarkable niches above it. They have the appearance of having been
placed there in recent times, when the west end was rebuilt. The arms of
Prior Hepburn are inserted in this wall, and they are also carved on one
of the south buttresses.</p>

<p>There are no windows in the north wall, but the interior contains
several good Renaissance monuments. In the floor is the flat tombstone
of John Wynram, Superintendent of Fife, who died in 1582; and against
the north wall is the monument of Robert Stewart, Earl of March, who was
commendator of the priory after the Regent Moray’s death.</p>

<p>The church was for long used for public worship, but after the College
of St. Leonards was united to that of St. Salvator in 1747, the former
was abandoned in 1759.</p>

<p>A long range of buildings on the south side of the church was occupied
as the students’ lodgings, but these were also abandoned, and have now
been converted into private residences.</p>

<p>Several alterations were likewise made on the church within recent
times, the steeple being taken down, and the west end “set back,” so as
to give more room for access to one of the private houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_451" id="page_451">{451}</a></span></p>

Tower, from North-East.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This church, usually called the Town Church, is of ancient foundation,
but was almost entirely rebuilt at the end of last century. The church
which was then demolished is believed to have been erected in 1412. The
north-west tower (Fig. <a href="#fig_1391">1391</a>) is the only part of the old structure which
survives. Like the north-west tower at Cupar it rises from the north and
west walls of the north aisle, without buttresses to mark its outline or
break the upright form of the walls. The square outline, however, is
partly relieved by a square projection at the north-west angle, which
contains the staircase. The east and south walls are carried by arches,
which formerly allowed the lower story of the tower to be included
within the church, and the round pier at the south-east angle is made of
extra thickness, so as to bear the weight of the tower. The tower is
carried up square to the parapet with only a string course beneath the
windows of the belfry story. In the latter trefoil-headed double windows
are introduced, except on the north side, where a mullioned window is
inserted between the stair turret and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_452" id="page_452">{452}</a></span> the east angle. The parapet is
plain and rests on simple corbels. Above this rises an octagonal spire,
with lucarnes. The spire is rather short and stunted, like most of the

<p>This fragment of a church is situated in the centre of its churchyard,
on the margin of a romantic glen, on the opposite side of which stands
the ruined Castle of Mains, in the region of Strath Dichty, about three
miles north from Dundee. The remains consist of a small building which
projected from the south side of the church, and which Mr. Muir<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
calls “the sacristy of the demolished church of Mains.” The view (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1399">1399</a>) shows three lancet windows in the south gable, which are of very
simple design, having merely a splay on their outer edge. The place is
locked up, but Mr. Muir says that the windows have separate rear-arches.</p>

<p>Over the window there is a very beautiful sculptured fragment
representing the Annunciation. It is sadly wasted, the head of the
Virgin, and what may have been the descending dove, being an indistinct
mass. The lower part of the figure, however, is well preserved, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_456" id="page_456">{456}</a></span>
extremely graceful. The figure of the angel, although wasted, is in good
preservation, while the scroll and pot of lilies are fairly distinct.
Beneath the pot there is a shield on which are visible two piles issuing
from a chief, with the remains of what may be mullets or annulets on the
piles. There were probably three piles at first.</p>

<p>This church is pleasantly situated at the head of a little valley
through which winds the stream of the Brothock, at a distance of between
one and two miles north from Arbroath or Aberbrothock. Previous to the
Reformation it was the parish church of Arbroath. The edifice stands on
the top of a regularly shaped mound, and occupies nearly the whole of
the summit. It has been the site of a religious settlement from a very
remote period, far earlier than the erection of the great abbey at
Arbroath. This is shown by several Norman wrought stones that have been
found on the site, as well as a large and most important group of
elaborately carved sculptured stones, relics of the Celtic church which
once stood here. Vigianus has been recognised as the Latinised form of
the name of St. Fechin of Fohbar, an Irish saint who died in 664. Dr.
Joseph Anderson mentions that the twelfth century builders had utilised
a large quantity of fragments of sculptured monuments as building
materials.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>In 1871, under the direction of Dr. R. Rowand Anderson, architect, the
church was restored and considerable additions were made to it. A large
polygonal apse, with massive buttresses, was built at the east end, a
second aisle was formed on the north side of the existing north aisle,
and the tower was raised and finished with a saddle-back roof. At the
same time a new roof and internal fittings were added, making the
edifice one of the most seemly parish churches in Scotland.</p>

<p>Previous to this restoration, the structure consisted (as shown in Fig.
<a href="#fig_1405">1405</a>) of a central nave of eight bays, with north and south aisles, and
a western tower. The original Norman church appears to have occupied the
site of the north aisle, and to have extended in width to about the
centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_460" id="page_460">{460}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">of the present nave. Parts of the east and west gable walls still
remain. At a later period, probably about the middle of the fifteenth
century, the church was extended to the south, and was converted into a
building with a nave and a north aisle; and again at a still later
period, in 1485, the south wall was taken down and a south aisle
erected. The north and south aisles correspond in a general way with
each other (Fig. <a href="#fig_1406">1406</a>), and although the pillars on the north side are
round and those on the south side are octagonal, both have very simple
caps and bases, all of late form.</p>

<p>The arches of the arcade on both sides are round with broad notched
splays. There are three clerestory windows on the north side, of a
square shape. They formerly had oak lintels on the inside, but these,
being decayed, were removed during the restoration, and the stone arches
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1406">1406</a> were put in. On the south side there are eight
clerestory windows, arched throughout.</p>

<p>The west tower is not in the centre, but occupies the space between the
centre of the nave and the line of the south arcade. It appears to be an
addition, but its lower plain vaulted story was probably erected before
the addition of 1485, while the upper portion is of later construction.
There is an entrance through the tower to the church, which, from the
relative positions of the two, is not in the centre. The opening of a
flat arched form is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1406">1406</a>.</p>

<p>In 1242 Bishop de Bernham consecrated the Church of St. Vigean. It was
again consecrated, along with two altars and the cemetery, in 1485 after
the additions were built by Bishop George O’Brien, Bishop of Dromore, in
Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> acting probably, as Dr. Duke says, for the Bishop of St.

of the monastery, and that it was, at a subsequent period, converted
into a pigeon house; but it is much more likely that, besides being the
belfry, it was also the pigeon house of the monastery from the first. It
appears to be still very much in its original state. The walls which
support the central portion (Fig. <a href="#fig_1408">1408</a>), which rise from arches in the
interior (Fig. <a href="#fig_1409">1409</a>) and give the structure its belfry-like aspect, are
evidently as old as any other part of the structure, and the supporting
arches with their corbels are not insertions.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in order to get solidity and strength in the
walls under these arches, the nests or pigeon holes are almost entirely
left out in those portions (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1409">1409</a>). The cross beam and upright
post seen in the sketch are old. The ladder, which is fixed, enabled a
man to go up and search for the eggs.</p>

been suppressed before the Reformation, about the year 1529, at which
date the brethren were translated to Peebles.</p>

westwards from the above, is built with rubble, and is apparently of
later date. The north wall is much broken down, but the other walls are
in fair preservation. The east end, as viewed from the interior (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1411">1411</a>) (where the growth of ivy allows the features to be tolerably
seen), is an unusual and rather striking design, consisting of two
narrow lancet windows, widely splayed internally, and a large
vesica-formed opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_466" id="page_466">{466}</a></span> above them. These windows have a broad double
splay on the exterior of the jambs and arches.</p>

<p>One round-headed and cusped window survives in the south wall close to
the east end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1412">1412</a>), and the Plan shows that there has been another
window adjoining, but it is now built up. The west end wall (Fig. <a href="#fig_1413">1413</a>)</p>

of Palladius, became to some extent identified with him. Be that as it
may, the name of Palladius has been handed down from the fifth century
in connection with a religious establishment in the place. A chapel, a
well, and an annual fair are named after him. The small chapel which now
bears the name of the Saint is a modern restoration. It is a plain
oblong structure (Fig. <a href="#fig_1414">1414</a>), 39 feet by 18 feet internally. The walls
are low, and there is a pointed gable at each end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1415">1415</a>). The east
wall has a recess, which probably contained a monument, and the west
wall a round-headed entrance doorway. There are three small
square-headed windows in the south wall and a doorway in the north wall.</p>

<p>The east end is probably the oldest part. There is a burial-vault
beneath it. An ambry with round head near the north door, and a plain
pointed piscina at the south side of the eastern recess, are the only
ancient appurtenances.</p>

<h2><a name="BLANTYRE_PRIORY_Lanarkshire" id="BLANTYRE_PRIORY_Lanarkshire"></a>BLANTYRE PRIORY, <span class="smcap">Lanarkshire</span>.</h2>

<p>The fragmentary ruins of this structure are situated on the left bank of
the Clyde near Bothwell, at a point where the river forms a sudden bend
from west to north, and where the priory is confronted on the opposite
side by the great donjon of Bothwell Castle. The eastern walls of the
priory stand on the very edge of a precipice, which rises perhaps 80 or
100 feet above the river. The buildings at this part are situated on
fairly level ground, but immediately to the west the ground rises
rapidly, so that the cloister garth (Fig. <a href="#fig_1417">1417</a>) and the western
enclosing walls are on a considerably higher level than the main
buildings. The ruins cover a space of ground measuring about 150 feet
from east to west by about 115 feet from north to south. The western
enclosing wall is from 5 to 10 feet in height, and the northern wall
stands to the height of about 10 feet. The southern wall is nearly all
gone, except a part at the return of the buildings at the east and west
ends.</p>

<p>At the north-east corner stands a two-storied structure, the walls of
which, except the south one, are almost entire. This was probably the
prior’s house. It enters by a doorway at the west end of the south wall,
and adjoining the door there appears to have been a stair to the upper
floor (which is the floor shown on the Plan), but the place is in so
confused a state with ruins and vegetation, that little regarding its
arrangement can be made out. The house contained two rooms, one at each
end, with the stair between. There are a fireplace and a window in each
gable, and the eastern window looks straight across the river to the
castle donjon. Along the north side of the house the ground is steep and
inaccessible. On the south side of this house there was a courtyard with
a building at the east end, the end wall of which still stands two
stories high, in continuation of the gable of the prior’s house.</p>

<p>Adjoining this to the south is an apartment said, by the local guide, to
be the chapel. Of this, however, almost nothing remains, except a part
of the west wall, in which there is a stoup (Fig. <a href="#fig_1418">1418</a>) hollowed out of
a stone wrought with all the appearance of a corbel, like those found in
the castles. On the face of the corbel is an incised cross. It is this
feature which has obtained for the apartment the name of the chapel.
There is a window in the west wall above the stoup, but with nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_471" id="page_471">{471}</a></span></p>

apartment, giving access to it. The path is protected from the cliff by
a parapet wall returned at the south end, where there is a shot hole.
This parapet has gone on to join the buildings at the prior’s house.</p>

<p>The parish church of Blantyre stood in a village of the same name, and
belonged to the priory, which is said to have been founded for Austin
canons, and endowed with the tithes and revenues of the parish church,
by Alexander <small>II.</small> Spottiswoode asserts that Blantyre was a cell depending
on Holyrood. In <i>Bagimond’s Roll</i> (1275), it is valued at £66, 13s. 4d.
Chalmers states that this small monastery was founded by Alexander <small>II.</small>
for canons regular brought from Jedburgh, and that the monks of Jedburgh
retired here during the war with England.</p>

<p>The barony belonged to the Dunbars as far back as 1368. Walter Stewart,
son of the Laird of Minto, was made commendator by James <small>VI.</small>, and the
Barony of Blantyre was erected, in 1606, into a temporal lordship in his
favour, with the title of Lord Blantyre.</p>

<p>According to the legendary history of the Blessed Virgin Triduan,
Lestalrig or Restalrig, a village to the east of Edinburgh, might claim
a very great antiquity. Triduan is said to have died at Restalrig in the
year 510.</p>

<p>A church can be traced here as early as the twelfth century, and it
afterwards became the parish church of Leith. This edifice is frequently
mentioned in connection with gifts bestowed upon it. The church of
Restalrig was erected into a Collegiate establishment by James <small>III.</small>, and
was rebuilt by him, as stated in the Papal Bull of 1487. James <small>IV.</small> was
also a benefactor to the foundation, and endowed an additional chaplain
in 1512, and twelve years later another rectory was annexed to the
church by James <small>V.</small></p>

<p>The edifice has unfortunately been almost entirely destroyed. In 1560 it
was resolved “that the Kirk of Restalrig, as a monument of Idolatrie be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_476" id="page_476">{476}</a></span></p>

<p>This building is a hexagon on plan (Fig. <a href="#fig_1424">1424</a>), measuring 29 feet in

church, against which the angle buttresses have impinged.</p>

<p>On each of the three sides facing towards the south there is a window,
now built up, each of which has a very flat four-centred arch, and
contains three cusped lights (Fig. <a href="#fig_1425">1425</a>), divided by two mullions. The
section of the jambs and mullions is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1426">1426</a>. The roof is

the foliage of the bosses is evidently of the third or late period (Fig.

<p>It is not known when the turf was piled up over the roof, but it is very
desirable that it should be removed, and the windows opened up, and the

<p>The ruined church of Newlands stands in the midst of the old churchyard,

</div>

<p>The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1430">1430</a>), which is a simple oblong in plan, is evidently
in some degree of ancient date; but it has been considerably altered in
post-Reformation times, in order to make it suitable for Presbyterian
service. For this purpose two large square-lintelled windows (Fig. <a href="#fig_1431">1431</a>)
have been inserted in the south wall, and one doorway near the east end
of that wall (Fig. <a href="#fig_1432">1432</a>) (the lintel of which bears the date of 1705).
The ancient round-arched doorway near the west end (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1431">1431</a>) has

<p class="nind">preserved, and has also been made available in later times. The later
internal arrangements would thus be the usual Presbyterian ones, of
having the pulpit placed in the centre of the south wall, with a large
window on each side of it, and a central passage down the church, to
which access was obtained by the two doorways near the east and west
ends.</p>

<p>The church was doubtless originally lighted by several small windows in
the south and west walls, and by a large pointed window in the east
wall. The latter (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1432">1432</a>) and the round-headed doorway near the
west end of the south wall are the principal ancient features. The
doorway has a bead on edge, and a plain hood moulding. It has all the
appearance of being of early date. The east end is partly built with
ashlar, and has a moulded string course near the ground running along
part of it. The pointed window has double splays on the jambs and arch,
both in the interior and exterior. It has doubtless had mullions at one
time, but it is now impossible to find traces of them. The window is
doubtless of third pointed date.</p>

<p>Various sepulchral enclosures have been added to the church, both
internally and externally. That at the west end (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1431">1431</a>) has
probably had a coat of arms in the recess above the door, but it is now
gone.</p>

<p>A number of quaintly carved tombstones of seventeenth and eighteenth
century date are still crumbling away in the churchyard.</p>

<p>“The name of Newlands refers to the era when the lands lying around the
Kirktown were first brought into cultivation by Scoto-Saxon bands.”<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
At the end of the thirteenth century Newlands belonged to the monks of
Dunfermline. In <i>Bagimond’s Roll</i> the <i>Rectoia de Newland</i>, in the
Deanery of Peebles, is valued at £16.</p>

<h2><a name="CROSS_CHURCH_Peebles" id="CROSS_CHURCH_Peebles"></a>CROSS CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Peebles</span>.</h2>

<p>The fragmentary ruins of the church of the monastery of the Redfriars
stand in the middle of a fir plantation immediately to the west of the
town of Peebles. All architectural interest connected with the edifice
has been destroyed. The freestone work which Grose specially commends
has been carried away, leaving only bare and ragged whinstone walls, and
giving the structure a very desolate appearance. The monastic buildings
were situated on the north side of the church; and the fir plantation,
which seems to represent their extent, runs in that direction for about
100 feet, with an average length from east to west of about 250 feet,
the whole extent of the plantation being a little less than an acre. It
is probable, from these dimensions, that the monastic buildings were
extensive, but, unfortunately, their destruction has been very complete.
The ruins of the nave remain (Fig. <a href="#fig_1433">1433</a>), and measure, within the walls,
about 70 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_483" id="page_483">{483}</a></span> 6 inches from east to west by a width of 26 feet 9
inches. Grose gives the length of the church as 102 feet, and there are
indications (see Plan) that it was longer at one time than it is now.
There is a tower at the west end, which measures about 20 feet by 21
feet, and had an opening into the church, now built solidly up. From a
view of the church in Grose’s <i>Antiquities of Scotland</i>, the building
was evidently in a much better condition in 1790 than now. It appears to
have been then entire, wanting only the roof, and the tower was finished
with a projecting parapet and two gables, after the manner of a pele
tower.</p>

<p>So completely has the place been harried that little is left to
describe. There were three pointed windows in the south wall and one in
the east gable, the latter of which (Fig. <a href="#fig_1434">1434</a>) still partly remains.
Against the north wall of the church there is an erection called the
Douglas vault, to which a door opens from the church. It is in a very
dilapidated state, although the vaulted roof is complete. Immediately to
the west of this vault, with a passage between of about 7 feet, there
are indications of other vaulted buildings, and similar indications are
found at the east end of the church, all in a very fragmentary
condition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_484" id="page_484">{484}</a></span> In the historical books relating to the locality, a story is
repeated of the finding, on this site, of a magnificent cross in 1261,
of the miracles performed by it, and the ultimate founding of a church
by the king, which was called the Cross Church. Such a church existed in
1296, for Frere Thomas, Mestre de la Maison de Seint Croce, de Pebblis,
swore fealty to Edward <small>I.</small> at Berwick.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

on the lintel of the door at the east end are cut the words “Feir God,”
with the date 1656. A portion to the west of this may have been</p>

form a school, probably at the date just mentioned.</p>

<p>The monastic buildings were used for various purposes, such as a school
and schoolmaster’s house, and for persons suffering from the plague, but
from about the beginning of the eighteenth century they gradually became
ruinous, and have now reached their present lamentable condition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_485" id="page_485">{485}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ST_ANDREWS_CHURCH_Peebles" id="ST_ANDREWS_CHURCH_Peebles"></a>ST. ANDREW’S CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Peebles</span>.</h2>

<p>Rather less than a quarter of a mile west from the Cross Church there
stands the tower of St. Andrew’s Church. It has been so completely
restored or transformed by the late Dr. Chambers, that it is now of no
interest whatever as a specimen of the ancient architecture of Scotland.
A view of the tower as it appeared at the end of the eighteenth century
will be found in the <i>Antiquities of Scotland</i> by Captain Grose; and on
the Ordnance Map there is a plan of the church, from which it may be
gathered that the tower was a western one, in a similar position to that
of the Cross Church. The plan shows a nave measuring about 75 feet long
by 40 feet wide, and a choir about 50 feet long, having apparently a
building of some kind, either an aisle or chapel, along the north side.
The total length of the building was about 140 feet.</p>

<p>The Church of St. Andrew at Peebles was consecrated by Bishop Jocelin of
Glasgow in 1195.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> St. Andrew’s was the parish church of Peebles.</p>

<p>In 1543 this church was made Collegiate. In 1548 it was burned down by
the English, and never rebuilt. Captain Grose says that all the arches
of the doors and windows were semicircular.</p>

probability give an idea of the extent of ground formerly occupied by
the monastery, and which is believed to have been the site of a Roman
camp.</p>

<p>The monastery was founded by Malcolm <small>IV.</small> in 1164, and was the sixth in
the order of construction of the thirteen Cistercian Abbeys in Scotland.
William the Lion granted a site for the abbey of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_492" id="page_492">{492}</a></span> about 50 acres of
land, and also gifted it with the King’s Chase and a portion of waste
land. In 1233 the church was dedicated, under the invocation of the
Blessed Virgin, during the time of Alexander, the eighth abbot. King
Alexander <small>II.</small> was a generous benefactor to the abbey, and amongst the
nobles the Hays of Errol and the Earls of Athole were conspicuous in
their gifts, the latter presenting, amongst other things, timber for the
construction of the buildings. At the Reformation the value of the
estates of the abbey are estimated by Dr. Rogers “as equal to at least
£8000 of present money.”</p>

<p>The buildings, it is believed, were destroyed by the excited multitude
who wrecked the religious houses at Perth and neighbourhood in 1559, and
a portion of the buildings seems to have been occupied as a residence by
Leonard Leslie, the first lay commendator, who died in 1605. In 1606
James <small>VI.</small>, desirous to “suppress and extinguish the memorie of the
abbacie,” converted the lands and baronies into a temporal lordship in
favour of James Elphinstone, second son of the first Lord Balmerino,
with the title of Baron Coupar. This lord appears to have made the abbey
his residence, as in 1645 it was assailed by 200 soldiers belonging to
the army of Montrose, in revenge for the support given to the
Covenanters by Elphinstone. Probably this was the finishing blow given
to the buildings, as in 1682 the place is described as “nothing but
rubbish.”</p>

<p>In the Rental Book, from 1480 and onwards, there are several notices of
the Porters, who, from their office, assumed that name as their family
designation, the office having become hereditary. When the last of them
demitted office it is stated in a charter that they had been hereditary
porters from time immemorial, and in the Chamberlain’s Accounts Robert
Porter received a commuted allowance, consequent on the secularisation
of the abbey.</p>

<p>At the west end of the present church there are the remains of some of
the main piers of the nave. As shown by Fig. <a href="#fig_1448">1448</a> these indicate work of
the first pointed period, probably of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>A broken slab, measuring about 3 feet 3 inches high by 3 feet in breadth
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1449">1449</a>), is lying in the churchyard. In the Rental Book it is
referred to as being built into the wall of the church which preceded
the present one (erected about thirty years ago), and as bearing “the
effigies of a priest,” with the inscription on the margin&mdash;<i>Monachus de
Cupro qui obiit anno dni. Millesimo quadringentesimo quqgesio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
From the present state of the fragment it is evident that little respect
is paid in Coupar to the remains of the ancient abbey.</p>

<p>The two sculptured slabs (Figs. <a href="#fig_1450">1450</a> and <a href="#fig_1451">1451</a>) which are at present
lying in a tool-house in all likelihood adorned the base of a mural
tomb. They are evidently works of the end of the fourteenth century or
of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_493" id="page_493">{493}</a></span>fifteenth century. They are supposed to be remains of a monument
to the Hays of Errol. Fig. <a href="#fig_1451">1451</a> appears to represent a pair who have
been guilty, and are suffering under the prospect of finding themselves
in the hands of the headsman.</p>

<p>In the Chamberlain’s Accounts for 1563 he describes the chapel “as being
so completely wrecked, that with a view to preserve the timber, he had
built up both doors; also the undermost door of the steeple. In the
cloister he had collected the slates which had been removed from the
roof. He had also repaired the broken windows, providing them with iron

<p>There are few notices of the buildings of the abbey. A plan of it was
made about 1820 by William Mitchell, a mason, who corresponded with</p>

<p>General Hutton regarding it; but they evidently could not come to terms,
and it is not in his collection in the Advocates’ Library. Mitchell
calls it “a true and just plan of the outlines of that pile of
building.”</p>

<p>Dr. Marshall, in his <i>Historic Scenes in Forfarshire</i>, p. 144, had this
plan before him when he wrote, and he characterises it as being
unreliable. After a good deal of correspondence we obtained a sight of
it, and have no hesitation in saying that it is a pure work of
imagination, and is not a plan of the abbey at all; and, judging from
the correspondence with General Hutton, we suspect the author intended
to play a hoax on him, and yet was afraid to go the full length, and
this is probably the reason why the General never got the plan.</p>

<p>In 1492 and following years there are references to Thomas Mowtray,
mason. He was sworn to be “leyl and trew,” during the term of his life,
to the abbot and chapter, and he is obliged to “wyrk leilly and
profitably the masonwerk of our forsaid abbay, and to be the master of
the werk, in al thingis that langis hys craft of masonry in our abbay or
in our qwarellis</p>

<p class="nind">as it nedis.” He was to have 6 “markis” yearly with his meat and drink,
a house with 2½ acres of land; further, the Lord Abbot “promised to give
him yearly one of his old albs reaching to the ankles.” He was to
instruct the “prentys” in all “craft of masonry.”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>In 1485 John, the mason, and his son are continued in the service of the
abbey. In 1468 Thomas Bel was hired “for the constant carpentry” of the
abbey; he had workmen under him and apprentices. There are also
agreements with smiths, as John Lutare, smith, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_497" id="page_497">{497}</a></span> “was hired (in 1484)
for the common work of the monastery in the forge,” and next year David
Smyth is hired to succeed William Byning, who was formerly in the same
service. John Duncanson, tiler, in 1492, was to labour in his trade and
in every other work which he knew. Nine years earlier John Sclater was
hired as apprentice to work at his trade of tiler (<i>tegulator</i>). Patrick
Dog (in 1490) was the abbey sawyer, with three workmen under him, who
each day were to turn out “fourteen draughts for each saw.”<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The small fragment of ancient work left at Forgandenny, a few miles
south of Perth, along with the more important remains in the district,
point to the importance of Strathearn in early times. That this has been
originally a Norman church there can be no doubt, and it is suggestive
and interesting to find such work here and at Dunning, each about two
miles distant from Forteviot, the residence of the early Pictish kings.</p>

<p>The building is still in use as the parish church, but has been greatly
altered at various times, and now it is only in some bits of detail that
its antiquity can be detected. It measures on the inside (Fig. <a href="#fig_1460">1460</a>) 70
feet 7 inches long by 21 feet 7 inches wide.</p>

<p>The east wall is in the main of Norman masonry. It has a splayed base,
which returns at each corner, but is soon lost, as shown on Plan, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_501" id="page_501">{501}</a></span>
the rapid rising of the ground towards the west. From the east end the
ground slopes downwards to a wooded dell which skirts the churchyard on
that side.</p>

<p>Two widely splayed narrow windows are shown on the Plan in the east
wall, but only the built centre mullion or pier now exists. It is of
fine masonry, in four courses 2 feet 10 inches high, and is set at a
height to the sill of about 8 or 9 feet above the floor. These windows
have been built up, and all traces of them were lost till an examination
of the wall for the purpose of preparing this Plan revealed their
existence.</p>

<p>Two or three windows in the side walls, with double splays on the
exterior, probably belong to the fifteenth century. They are
square-headed, and have been greatly knocked about. In the north wall
there is a peculiar narrow door about 2 feet 3 inches wide, splayed on
the exterior and lintelled like the windows just mentioned.</p>

<p>The doorway to the church, which is now built up, was in the south side
near the west end. It appears to have been of Norman work, and a small
piece of its enrichment still remains, consisting (Fig. <a href="#fig_1461">1461</a>) of the
trigonal moulding with a double notch enrichment, frequently found in
the outer member of Norman arches. At some later time a porch has been
added, as shown on the Plan, when probably the Norman door was
dismembered, and the fragment now shown was built into the wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_502" id="page_502">{502}</a></span>

<p>The abbey was founded by Gilbert, Earl of Stratherne, who succeeded his
father, Earl Ferteth, in 1171, and died in 1223, and his first wife,
Matildis, the daughter of William de Aubegni. Their eldest son,
Gilchrist, was buried in 1198 at Inchaffray, which had been founded
before that date. In 1200, when the great charter of the abbey was
granted, the Earl and Countess endowed it with various churches,
including St. Mechesseok of Ochterardouer and St. Beanus of Kynkell
(illustrated in this volume). They declared their affection for
Inchaffray, affirming “so much do we love it that we have chosen a place
of sepulture in it for us and our successors, and have already buried
there our eldest born.”</p>

and Alexander, Kings of Scotland,” but its principal benefactors were
the family of the Earls of Stratherne, Earl Robert, the son (1223 and
1231) of Gilbert being particularly liberal.</p>

<p>Only one of the abbots, Abbot Maurice, has obtained any popular
recognition in history. He it was who blessed the Scottish army at
Bannockburn in 1314. Five years afterwards he was promoted to the See of
Dunblane, within which diocese Inchaffray is situated.</p>

<p>The first head of the house was Malis, a religious hermit, in whose
piety and discretion Earl Gilbert and Matildis had full confidence. At
the Reformation Inchaffray suffered the usual fate. Alexander Gordon,
brother of George, fourth Earl of Huntly, was made commendator in 1553.
Five years later he was promoted to the See of Galloway, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_504" id="page_504">{504}</a></span> shortly
afterwards he was accused, by the General Assembly, of neglecting his
duties, and in particular, that he had resigned Inchaffray in favour of
a young child, and set divers lands in feu in prejudice of the kirk. The
young child was James Drummond, son of David, Lord Drummond of
Innerpeffray, in whose favour the abbey was erected into a temporal
lordship.</p>

<p>The ruins of the abbey are situated on ground which rises slightly above
the surface of the valley. This valley in ancient times was a great</p>

situation that the abbey received the name by which it was very
generally known throughout the middle ages, of “Insula Missarum,” or
Isle of Masses. As early as the year 1218 the monks had reclaimed a
portion of this marsh, and they doubtless continued their labours; but
it was not till 1696 that an Act was obtained, under the authority of
Parliament, for dealing effectively with it.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_505" id="page_505">{505}</a></span></p>

<p>The fields around the abbey are now all cultivated, and the ruins are
enclosed with stone dykes, as shown by double lines on the Plan (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1464">1464</a>); so that the few fragments which remain are now properly
protected. Within the dykes almost nothing is visible but a dense mass
of trees and brushwood, with mounds of ruins in the utmost confusion. A
gable at the north-west corner stands entire (Fig. <a href="#fig_1465">1465</a>), with a
round-arched vault adjoining, about 21 feet long by 10 feet 6 inches
wide and 10 feet high. This is one of the</p>

<p class="nind">cellars of the western range of buildings. The walls of this range are
fairly entire along their whole length for a height of 7 or 8 feet. The
south end wall is also standing for about the same height. The length of
this range from north to south is about 97 feet 7 inches. It is probable
that the adjoining cellar to the south is entire, but the place is so
covered with vegetation that little can be ascertained. The doorway
entering from the cloister to the north-west cellar is undoubtedly of an
early date. Not much of it remains, but enough to enable the Plan (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1466">1466</a>) to be made. The nook shaft, a fragment of the capital of which
exists, is not later than the beginning of the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The high gable adjoining (Fig. <a href="#fig_1467">1467</a>) is certainly in part at least of a
later date; the upper part and the chimney, with its corbelled cope,
being of the sixteenth or seventeenth century. On the first floor there
has been a large fireplace, the flue of which is still partly visible
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_1467">1467</a>). A part of the north wall of the cloister stands near
the gable. This was part of the south wall of the church (see Plan), and
the greater portion of the church would thus be situated outside the
present enclosing dyke on the north side.</p>

<p>There are indications at the north-east corner of the surviving gable
(at <span class="sans">A</span> on Plan) of a wall having extended northwards, which was probably
the west wall of the church. At the junction of the south wall of the
church and the wall of the western range, and at the height of about 15
feet above the ground, there still exists the corner corbel for
supporting the roof of the cloister walk. We can remember when there
were other corbels along the church wall also, but they have now
disappeared. The part of this wall now standing is in a very precarious
state. It evidently extended eastwards for about 120 feet, when it met a
cross wall, now represented by a mass of rough masonry about 7 or 8 feet
square (see Plan). This mass may represent one of the great piers of a
central tower. There are other pieces of masonry throughout the
enclosure with numerous trenches and mounds, but, owing to the rank
vegetation, it is impossible to make a more satisfactory Plan than the
one now given. If the place were cleared out and a judicious search
made, considerable remains would doubtless be found.</p>

<p>The average length of the enclosure as it now stands is about 210 feet.</p>

<p>The structure of this church is still entire, although the building is

overlooking the river Earn, about four miles south-east from Crieff.
Near the church on the bank of the river stands the ruined Castle of

<p>The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1468">1468</a>) is divided, by modern walls, into three parts. It
is a long narrow building, measuring, internally, about 76 feet in

north side near the east end, its width and position being indicated by

the whole side walls except at this part. The door between the church
and sacristy still remains, but is built up. On the sacristy side it has
a rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_508" id="page_508">{508}</a></span> flat arch. To the east of this door there is, on the exterior,
a splayed aperture about 2 feet 9 inches wide (see Plan) by about 2 feet
high, and about the same height above the ground. There is no trace of
it inside, the walls being plastered. This may have been what is called
a squint,</p>

<p class="nind">being situated in the same relative position as those at Seton and other
churches.</p>

<p>The Church of Innerpeffray is peculiar, from having what resembles a
chancel arch, situated at a distance of about 7 feet 6 inches from the
west end. This arch (Fig. <a href="#fig_1470">1470</a>) is round and about 14 feet 2 inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_509" id="page_509">{509}</a></span>
wide. It has a splayed squint about 2 feet wide on the south side, as
shown on the sketch. It is difficult to give a satisfactory explanation
of this arch, but it seems to have formed a vestibule in connection with
the stair leading to an apartment on the upper floor. The archway
appears to have been fitted with some kind of timber screen, which, if
it was a close one, would help to explain the object of the squint.</p>

<p>There is a room on the first floor reached by the wheel stair in the</p>

<p class="nind">north-west angle. This room, as it now exists, is of later construction
than the church, and is not older than the seventeenth century. The
stair, however, is part of the original construction, and is believed to
have given access to a belfry on the west wall, as well as to the room
which doubtless existed from the first over the vestibule, and which
(see Fig. <a href="#fig_1469">1469</a>) was provided with a fireplace and a window in the west
gable.</p>

<p>The ceiling of the existing room (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1470">1470</a>) cuts across the archway
in an awkward manner. Doubtless the original room was at a slightly
higher level, so as not to interfere with the arch. The ceiling and
floor of the room are in a very ruinous state, the greater part having
fallen. The ceiling is painted in bright colours. It has a figure of the
sun in the centre with rolling clouds around, and till lately there was
a complete figure of an angel on one side, of which only slight
indications now remain. On</p>

<p>The church, in its original state, had three doorways, one in the centre
of the west end and one in the south wall, the latter being secured (see
Plan) by a sliding bar. Both these doors have bead and hollow mouldings.
The third door was in the north wall and is now built up. There are six
windows in the south wall, the two westmost ones adjoining the great
arch being markedly narrower than the others, and having evidently some
connection with the west arch. These windows have all double splays on
the exterior, except the eastmost one (Fig. <a href="#fig_1471">1471</a>), which has a large
quarter hollow moulding continued round the lintel, on which occurs a
shield with the Drummond arms.</p>

<p>All the windows and doors have square lintels, with the mouldings or
splays of the jambs continued round the lintels. The mode of securing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_510" id="page_510">{510}</a></span>
the side door has already been referred to; all the windows are likewise
strongly secured with iron interlacing bars.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig_1472">1472</a> shows the jamb moulding of the south doorway. Over this
doorway there is a small pointed opening (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1469">1469</a>), probably
intended to throw light on the rood screen which stood near it, as is
evident from the corbels for carrying it, three of which still exist on
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_511" id="page_511">{511}</a></span> south side (see Plan) and one on the opposite side, the others
having been removed to admit a monument. On the north side two of these
corbels are placed (Fig. <a href="#fig_1473">1473</a>), one on each side of one of the windows,
which, as will be seen, has been converted into a doorway to give access
to the central burial vault. Alongside the south door there is the stoup
(see Figs. <a href="#fig_1473">1473</a> and <a href="#fig_1474">1474</a>)). It is of plain design, with a slightly
projecting bracket. The piscina or small recess at the east end is quite
plain, not even having a splay.</p>

<p>A very interesting feature of this church is the altar, which is still
standing against the east wall (see Plan). It has been rough cast over,
so that it cannot be examined thoroughly. It is needless to say that few
ancient altars remain in Scotland, one of the best preserved ones being

exterior of which church is subjoined (Fig. <a href="#fig_1475">1475</a>).<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Stobhall and
Innerpeffray churches were both built by the same family of the
Drummonds, who adhered to the ancient faith, and successfully defied the
power of the reformed Church to cast down their monuments of idolatry,
as altars and other appendages of the ancient Church were termed.</p>

<p>The east gable at Innerpeffray is quite plain, with the exception of a
small niche, which probably held a figure. Besides the painted ceiling
already referred to, there are considerable traces of painting
throughout the interior, particularly on the east wall. Several
consecration crosses are also painted on various parts of the church.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be seen that this is a church of very
considerable interest and some almost unique peculiarities, and it is
unfortunate that it should be divided up with unseemly walls, and that
no effort should be made to preserve the painted work, of which so
little remains in Scotland. Were it put in the same condition as the
Church of Stobhall and as well cared for, it would be a circumstance for
which all who are interested in Scottish church architecture would be
grateful.</p>

<p>This church, which was a Collegiate one, was dedicated to the Blessed
Virgin, and was founded by Sir John Drummond, the first of Innerpeffray,
in 1508. In the account which follows (kindly supplied by Mrs. Birnie,
keeper of the Library) it appears that a church existed here in the
previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_512" id="page_512">{512}</a></span> century, and indeed it is stated<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> that it is mentioned as
early as 1342. The existing building, however, was doubtless erected at
the period above mentioned.</p>

<p>“In 1483 the Church of Innerpeffray must have been in existence, as the
patronage is then conveyed by the Mercers to Lord Oliphant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1475" style="width: 525px;">

</div>

<p>“One reason for considering the foundation of considerable antiquity is
the fact that the market held on the day of dedication (Lady-day) was
one of the great marts and one of the great holidays of Strathearn. (The
market was removed to Crieff about eighty years ago.) Institutions so
popular as this are generally found to have their origin in a remote
antiquity.... Its proximity also to the meeting point of the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_513" id="page_513">{513}</a></span> Roman
roads, from Ardoch and the south, from Comrie and Loch Earn on the west,
from the Sma’ Glen on the north, and from Perth on the east, made it a
suitable centre.... Convenience of access and the popularity of Lady
Fair appear to confirm the remote date of the church, &amp;c.</p>

<p>“John Freebairn, minister and preacher of the Gospel at Madderty
(1620-1657), who was connected with the Drummonds by marriage, in a
genealogical history of the House of Drummond, leaves on record the
following:&mdash;‘John, first Lord Drummond, having re-edified the Chapel of
Innerpeffray from the ground and erected it into a college for some few
prebendaries to pray for requiems for him and his house, ordained it to
be their burying-place for all time coming, and being near 80 years of
age he framed one of the most material and perfyte testaments that ever
I saw and syne closed his eyes and time togidder and was most honourably
interred at Innerpeffray, in the year 1519.’</p>

<p>“On 4th June 1507 the King confirmed in Mortmain the charter of John,
Lord Drummond, by which (for the souls of the King and Queen, for his
own soul and that of Elizabeth Lindesay, his wife, and the umquhile
Margaret Drummond, his daughter, &amp;c.) he granted as a pure free almsgift
to four chaplains, to celebrate the divine offices for ever at the four
altars in the church, dedicated in honour of the Blessed Virgin, of
Innerpeffray, an annual income of forty marks from his lands of
Innerpeffray and Dunfallys, with houses, residences, and gardens to be
marked off and built for each, with the right to each of them of
obtaining necessary fuel in the Common Mure of Innerpeffray with four
sums for grasses and for one horse. In 1508 occurs the name of Walter
Drummond, the first Provost of Innerpeffray. Here was buried the second
Master of Drummond, who died before his grandfather, and left an infant
son, David, afterwards second Lord Drummond....</p>

<p>“The King, on 20th October 1581, confirmed the charter of William
Lindesay, provost or principal perpetual chaplain of the Church of the
Blessed Virgin Mary of Innerpeffray, in which with consent of Patrick,
Lord Drummond, patron of the said provostry, he demised to James
Drummond of Innerpeffray six acres of land, the Smithlands, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
reserving to the said provost one chamber (camera) only when he should
stay there.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>... Four roundles or towers stood one at each corner of
the churchyard, and tradition says that these formed the residences of
the four chaplains.”</p>

<p>This edifice is situated about four miles east from Perth, and continued
to be the parish church till about forty years ago, when it was
abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_514" id="page_514">{514}</a></span> and allowed to fall into ruin. It is now roofless and the
walls are very much reduced, except the south aisle, which contained the
seats of the family of the Greys of Kinfauns and their burial-place.
When the church was dismantled a painting was found on the plaster
inside the west wall, but unfortunately no drawing was made of it, and
it has now entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1476">1476</a>) measures about 65 feet long by 18 feet 2 inches
wide within the walls, and is probably a structure of the fifteenth
century. It has been considerably altered during Presbyterian times, new
windows and doors having been broken through the walls. The south
doorway is original, and is round arched with a bead moulding towards
the outside,</p>

it, evidently a companion stone to the one shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1477">1477</a>. This
cross, which wants part of its length, measures 5 feet 11 inches long by
1 foot 7 inches in width at top, tapering to 1 foot 4 inches at lower
end by 10 inches thick. It is well wrought with sloping sides, having
the form of the cross completed, as seen by the rounded disc rising out
of the slope on each side. There was probably a south doorway opposite
the north doorway, adjoining the stoup shown in the south wall. The
eastmost window on the south side is also original; it is square
lintelled and has the usual wide splay all round.</p>

<p>The most interesting feature in the church is the arched recess in the
north wall (see Fig. <a href="#fig_1477">1477</a>), which was probably an Easter sepulchre. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_515" id="page_515">{515}</a></span>

been covered over. It has thus been well preserved, except that the
projecting crockets along the top of the hood moulding, as well as most
of the hood itself, have been chipped away, so as to make an even
surface at the wall. It measures about 6 feet 6 inches long by 3 feet in
depth, and about 4 feet high. It has well wrought mouldings, which die

<p>The old country town of Meigle is situated in the middle of Strathmore,
not far from Alyth Junction on the railway between Perth and Forfar.</p>

<p>The church stood in the middle of the village, and was rebuilt about<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_518" id="page_518">{518}</a></span>
the beginning of this century. When the old building was demolished, a
font was dug out of the rubbish and erected on a pedestal in the
minister’s garden. It remained there for a time, but when an Episcopal
chapel was built, the font was removed into it, and is now in use there.
It is one of the best specimens of an old font now remaining in
Scotland,</p>

<p>The font is octagonal and made of one stone. It is 2 feet 3 inches in
diameter, and the basin measures 1 foot 9 inches across. Each of the
sides of the octagon contains an arch with carved crockets, and the
angles are marked by small buttresses and pinnacles. The carved work has
been very spirited, but is now much damaged. In each arch is a
bas-relief containing emblems and scenes connected with the Passion.</p>

<p>Of the Church of Methven, consecrated by Bishop David de Bernham of St.
Andrews on 25th August 1247, nothing now remains.</p>

<p>The Collegiate Church or Provostry of Methven, as it is generally
called, was founded in 1433 by Walter Stewart, the aged Earl of Athole.
Before this time, King James i. had conferred the liferent of the
Earldom of Strathearn upon the Earl of Athole, so that he was the great
lord of the district, and was, besides, a son of Robert ii. Three years
after the founding of this church he suffered a terrible death, for his
supposed connivance in the assassination of James i. in Perth.</p>

<p>What now remains of the church is the north transept, the north wall and
gable of which are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1482">1482</a>. In the <i>Edinburgh Architectural
Association Sketch Book</i><a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> a plan of the church is given without any
information as to how it was ascertained. Assuming it to be correct, it
shows a cross church, having a chancel 40 feet long by 24 feet wide over
the walls, with north and south transepts, and a nave of the same width
as the chancel, extending for an indefinite length. The north transept
extended from the north wall of the church 22 feet, and has a width over
the walls of 21 feet, with walls 3 feet thick. The end window, which is
the principal feature of the structure, is 6 feet 3 inches wide in the
daylight; it has three lights, and the tracery, which is of a flowing
pattern, is placed, as usual at this period, in the centre of the
thickness of the wall. The mouldings of the jambs, which consist of a
double splay, are stopped at the springing of the arch by a continuous
impost moulding, and the arch mouldings are of a different section. On
the east side of the window there is a bracket with a canopy over for a
statue, possibly that of St. Marnoch, the patron saint of Methven.</p>

<p>In a panel on the west side of the window there are traceable the lion
rampant of the royal arms, surmounted by a crown.</p>

<p>The gabled crowsteps with which the gable is coped form one of the best
examples of that feature, which, however, is a rare one in the churches
of this period. The cross on the apex is modern.</p>

<p>The collegiate church was in use as the parish church till 1783, and for
long after the Reformation the Presbyterian minister was called “Provest
of Methven, and Chaplin of Auldbar,” the Church of Auldbar having been
granted to Methven on its foundation in 1433.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_520" id="page_520">{520}</a></span></p>

(Fig. <a href="#fig_1484">1484</a>) with a pointed arch cut out of a single stone, and in the
north wall there is the usual ambry. There are two windows in the south
wall and one in the west gable. This gable has the usual set-off at
about 5 feet above the ground, and at the ground level in this wall
there is a wide relieving arch, apparently intended to give scope for a
tree root. The skews of this gable are finely wrought, and the apex
stone, now lying inside (Fig. <a href="#fig_1485">1485</a>), has the edge fillet continued as a
saltier on the face of the ridge roll.</p>

<p>The belfry, entirely concealed by ivy, occupies an unusual position on
the east gable. All the openings are lintelled, and appear to have been
altered in Presbyterian times.</p>

<h2><a name="WAST-TOWN_CHURCH_Perthshire" id="WAST-TOWN_CHURCH_Perthshire"></a>WAST-TOWN CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Perthshire</span>.</h2>

<p>A ruined structure situated in the centre of its churchyard, in the
decayed hamlet of Wast-Town, at a distance of about two miles northwards
from Errol Railway Station, and not far from the old Castle of Kinnaird.
The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1486">1486</a>) has consisted of a nave and chancel, the former
about 43 feet long by 15 feet 2 inches wide inside, having walls from 3
to 4 feet thick. The chancel was apparently of the same width as the
nave,</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">but it has been entirely demolished, and the chancel arch has been built
up. This was doubtless done to make the church suitable as a preaching
station after the Reformation. There are a north and a south doorway,
the former square-headed with a splay, the latter (Fig. <a href="#fig_1488">1488</a>) round
arched with a bead on edge all round. In the south side there are two
windows with square tops and a bead moulding, and one window in the
north side having a cusped and pointed top, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1487">1487</a>. This
window has a moulding on the outside consisting of a hollow, wrought on
a broad splay. All the windows are finished on the inside in a manner
similar to the one shown, the width of their daylight being about 13
inches. There are three openings through the walls at the west end (see
Fig. <a href="#fig_1486">1486</a>) about 7 inches square and about 4 feet above the ground, the
object of which is not very clear, and they are now considerably ruined.

<h2><a name="MONUMENT_IN_RENFREW_CHURCH" id="MONUMENT_IN_RENFREW_CHURCH"></a>MONUMENT IN RENFREW CHURCH.</h2>

<p>This monument is placed in the modern parish church of Renfrew. It
consists of a recumbent effigy resting on a sculptured tomb, and
enclosed within an arched canopy. The inscription round the arch in
Gothic raised letters is as follows:&mdash;“Hic iacet Johēs Ros miles
quo(n)dam dominus de Hawkehede et Marioria uxor sua orate pro ipsis qui
obit.”</p>

<p>Crawford mentions in his <i>History of Renfrewshire</i>, p. 66, that Sir
Josias (he means Sir John) Ross of Halkhead married “Marjory Mure, a
daughter of Caldwel,” and that their statues “as big as the life, with
their coats of arms over them,” are carved on the monument. The arms of
the lady are not there now. Crawford states that this was “the first of
the family who laid the foundation of that hereditary honour, which his
successors have ever since enjoyed, who, being a favourite of King James
<small>IV</small>., was by that prince created a baron of this realm, with the title of
Lord Ross of Hawkhead and Melvil, about the year 1492.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> It is to be
observed, however, that the arms on the tomb are simply those of Ross,
whereas the arms of Melville were quartered with those of Ross after the
marriage of Sir John Ross with the heiress of Melville in the time of
Robert <small>II.</small></p>

<p>The monument (Fig. <a href="#fig_1491">1491</a>) has been partly restored, the shafts at the
sides with their bases and caps are modern, but they probably follow the
original design. The mouldings of the arch, which are thickly coated
with paint, appear to be original. The effigies, of which there are two,
husband and wife, with the table on which they rest, remain untouched.</p>

<p>The tomb is 8 feet 6½ inches long by 2 feet 6 inches high, but the base
is probably buried beneath the floor. The front is richly sculptured in
a somewhat rude but vigorous manner, and is divided into eleven
compartments. Each of the end compartments contains an angel playing on
a musical instrument, namely, a violin and a viol. The other nine
compartments contain shields supported by angels, with the following
armorial bearings, as described by Mr. W. R. Macdonald:&mdash;</p>

and is believed to have stood on the present site.</p>

<p>In 1557 mention is made of the chaplainry of St. Christopher in the Lord
Ross’s Aisle on the south side of the Church of Renfrew. The monument is
situated on the south side of the present church. The Chapel of St.
Christopher was probably connected with the ferry across the Clyde.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHURCHES_OF_HOUSTON_ST_FILLANS_AND_KILMALCOLM_Renfrewshire" id="THE_CHURCHES_OF_HOUSTON_ST_FILLANS_AND_KILMALCOLM_Renfrewshire"></a>THE CHURCHES OF HOUSTON, ST. FILLAN’S, AND KILMALCOLM, <span class="smcap">Renfrewshire</span>.</h2>

<p>These three churches lie to the north-west of Paisley, in a straight
line, about four miles apart. The Church of Houston is modern, and the
only thing belonging to the ancient church which formerly stood there is
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1492">1492</a>, being the recumbent figures of one of the Houston
family and his wife. The monument which contained these statues is
entirely gone, and they now lie in a lighted closet, built for their
reception, beside the new church. The Houston arms are carved on the
knight’s armour (a fesse chequé between three martlets). The figures
probably date from the fifteenth century, and are believed to represent
Sir Patrick Houston of that Ilk, who died in 1450, and his wife, Agnes
Campbell, who died in 1456. Crawford states<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> that Sir Patrick,
departing this life 1450, was buried in the Chapel of Houston, where
there is a fair monument erected to the memory of him and his wife, with
this inscription:&mdash;“Hic jacet Patricius Houstoun, de Eodem, miles, qui
obiit anno <small>MCCCCL</small>; et D. Maria Colquhoun sponsa dicti Domini Johannis
quae obiit <small>MCCCCLVI</small>.”</p>

<p>The parish of <span class="smcap">Kilfillan</span> or <span class="smcap">Killallan</span> was incorporated with Houston in
1760, and the church dedicated to St. Fillan has probably been in a
state of ruin since about that time. It stands in a beautiful hollow in
an elevated situation overlooking the valley of Strathgryfe, midway
between Houston and Kilmalcolm. The walls are fairly entire, but without
the gables, and are densely covered with ivy. The masonry shows that
they are of considerable age, if indeed they are not of the Norman
period. While this may be so, all the openings are of seventeenth
century work, and the doorway at the west end of the south wall is dated
1635. About that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_528" id="page_528">{528}</a></span> time the openings were probably changed into their
present forms, and the pre-Reformation character of the building was
altered to suit Presbyterian</p>

three plain lancet windows, which may possibly belong to the thirteenth
century. It forms a part of the parish church. The above three churches,

<p>The grave slab shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1494">1494</a> is built into one of the walls of the
existing ruins. It is of red sandstone, and measures 6 feet 4 inches
high by 2 feet 5 inches wide. It is very much mutilated, and from its
exposed situation and the friableness of the stone, it is rapidly
decaying, and unless some proper means are taken to preserve it, will at
no distant date be obliterated. The figure represents that of a stout
yeoman with hands folded on the breast, having a belt round his waist.

commemorate one of the Scots of Harden, who lived at Aikwood or Oakwood,
a tower still standing not far from Selkirk. The stone probably dates
from about the early part of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The following figures represent three stoups in the possession of Mr.
Craig Brown, Selkirk. Fig. <a href="#fig_1495">1495</a> shows the five sides of one of these. On
one face is a lion rampant, and on the adjoining space to the right is a
human face, the mouth of which forms an opening for emptying the basin.
On the space to the left is carved the figure of a buck or hart. The
other two faces are broken. On one is the hind quarters of an ox<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_532" id="page_532">{532}</a></span> having
a long tail and cloven feet, and on the other the forequarters and head
of a hare in full flight.</p>

<p>The lion may be heraldic or it may have a symbolic meaning. The hart is
probably an allusion to the beginning of the xlii. psalm&mdash;“As the hart
panteth after the water brooks.” This verse is inscribed on a font of
the eleventh century, at Potterne, Wilts,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> and the figure of a hart

was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_533" id="page_533">{533}</a></span> taken down many years ago. A mason took possession of it and used
it for a flower pot, and chiselled a hole in the bottom. The fragment

string course and other bits of minor detail at the east end, it would
appear that the building has been originally of first pointed date,
though perhaps still earlier features were destroyed at the various
repairs which it underwent in modern times. One or two objects&mdash;The
stump of a cross, and a small baptismal font of tapering form” (which
seems to have now disappeared)&mdash;“were to all appearance Norman, and very
likely, therefore, the earlier portion of the primitive structure was of
twelfth century date.” The church was dedicated to St. Machutus, and
belonged to the Priory of Whithorn.</p>

<h2>CHURCHES OF THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES.</h2>

<p>The ecclesiastical architecture of the mediæval period terminated at the
introduction of the Reformation in 1560, but during the latter half of
the sixteenth and the greater part of the seventeenth century a number
of churches were erected which show some attempt to maintain or revive
the style of earlier times. This tendency was doubtless encouraged by
the strenuous effort which was made, under James <small>I.</small> and Charles <small>I.</small> and
<small>II.</small>, to establish the Episcopal forms of Church government and service
in Scotland. These forms being contrary to the desire of the
Presbyterians, who comprised the great body of the people, gave rise to
two opposing parties. The party favourable to the Episcopal form of
religion supported the erection of churches and the maintenance of the
worship as nearly as possible after the old model, while the
Presbyterians and Puritans discouraged everything which savoured of the
ancient faith, whether in buildings or services. The result was that
during the century which followed the Reformation there were two styles
of ecclesiastical structures erected in the country, one style showing
some reverence for the house of God in its form and decoration, and in
the appropriateness of the divine service; while the other seemed to be
designed, both in its buildings and forms of worship, to be as far
removed as possible from any outward or visible sign of inward sweetness
or grace.</p>

<p>It is proposed to conclude this work with some examples of the different
styles of churches erected during the above period.</p>

<p>A number of specimens have already been given in a former work.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>These churches were introduced into a work on the domestic architecture
of the country, in order to illustrate the influence of the domestic
style on the ecclesiastical architecture of this period. Many of these
edifices were, therefore, only partially illustrated, and it has been
thought desirable to treat some of them more fully in this book, so as
to complete the illustration and description of their architecture.</p>

<p>The examples which are now given will amply illustrate the remaining
specimens which still survive of this somewhat heterogeneous epoch.</p>

<p>Most of the churches of the seventeenth century are either very poor
imitations of Gothic work or tasteless examples of plain walls, while a
few contain the germs of what might have been wrought into a picturesque
style, founded on the domestic architecture of the period. Such, for
example, are the churches of Stirling (west end), Anstruther Easter, and
Pittenweem.</p>

<p>Several of the monuments of the period are also given.</p>

<p>The following examples are arranged in alphabetical order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_535" id="page_535">{535}</a></span></p>

scribe, writing in the eleventh or twelfth century, tells of the

round, with an impost moulding (Fig. <a href="#fig_1501">1501</a>) at the springing of the arch.
The arch and jambs are chamfered, the chamfer terminating on a splayed
base. In the north wall of the nave is the round arched mural tomb shown
in Fig. <a href="#fig_1502">1502</a>.</p>

<p>The font is still in existence. It is quite plain and octagonal, being 2
feet in diameter by about 2 feet 2 inches high. After the abandonment of
the church the font appears to have been built into the wall, and to
have had a sundial carved on its lower end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1503">1503</a>).</p>

<p>These adjacent towns form one of the very interesting group of ancient
seaports and places of commerce on the northern shore of the Frith of
Forth. Anstruther is divided into two portions by the little river
Dreel, which formed the harbour of Anstruther Wester, while Easter
Anstruther extends in a wide crescent along the coast, and has a larger
harbour of its own.</p>

<p>Anstruther Wester belonged to the Priory of Pittenweem, and the parish
church was dedicated to St. Nicolas. The town obtained a charter<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_537" id="page_537">{537}</a></span> from
the monastery in 1549, and another in 1554.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> The church is now
modernised, but the old tower (Fig. <a href="#fig_1504">1504</a>) is a fair specimen of the
keep-like structures so often erected in connection with Scottish
churches in the sixteenth century.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1504" style="width: 315px;">
<a href="images/ill_pg_537.jpg">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1504.</span>&mdash;Anstruther Wester.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Anstruther Easter was, before the Reformation, in the parish of
Kilrenny, and was disjoined from it by the General Assembly, with the
consent of the bailies and council of the town, in 1639. In 1640
Anstruther Easter was erected into a separate parish, and the reason
assigned in the Act was “the Burgh being a part of the parish of
Kilrenny a mile distant of deep evil way in winter and rainy
times.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>A proposal to build a church at Anstruther Easter had thus been in
contemplation for some time, and in 1636 an agreement was come to
regarding it between Mr. Colin Adams, the first minister of the parish,
and the bailies and council. The new church was erected, and “ten years
later a steeple was added after a Dutch model.”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_538" id="page_538">{538}</a></span></p>

<p>The arrangement of the Plan (Fig. <a href="#fig_1505">1505</a>) and the design of the tower
seem, however, to contradict the latter statement. The debased but
picturesque architecture of the tower (Fig. <a href="#fig_1506">1506</a>) so strongly resembles
the other Scottish church towers of the period as to render its origin
beyond dispute. It combines the ornamental treatment of the upper part
with the plain features of the lower portion, so usual in the castles of
the time; and the classic balustrade and the gabled termination of the
staircase recall similar domestic features of Scottish castellated
architecture very common in the seventeenth century, both in churches
and houses.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1505.</span>&mdash;Anstruther Easter. Plan.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The church measures, externally, 92 feet in length by 41 feet in
breadth. The entrance doorway leads into a simple barrel-vaulted passage
9 feet wide. This originally opened directly into the body of the
church, having a staircase to the gallery on the south side and a small
room or vestry on the north side. The body of the church is of the usual
oblong form (Fig. <a href="#fig_1507">1507</a>) and is lighted with windows, which, from their
mullions and round arches, retain a slightly ecclesiastical appearance.
This is chiefly striking in the large east window. There were originally
two doorways in the south wall, but one has been built up.</p>

<p>Altogether, this church, the date of which is known, forms a complete
and characteristic example of the Scottish ecclesiastical architecture
of the earlier part of the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_539" id="page_539">{539}</a></span></p>

<p>The south doorway in the chancel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1510">1510</a>) also belongs to the earlier
church. The moulded jambs (Fig. <a href="#fig_1511">1511</a>) abut against a square lintel,
somewhat in the same manner as occurs in one of the windows in the tower
at South Queensferry. The jambs rise at the base from a splay sloping
inwards. The doorway to the nave (Fig. <a href="#fig_1512">1512</a>) is more classic in design,
and is of the seventeenth century. No other features of the church,
except its sundials (see <i>The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of
Scotland</i>, Vol. <small>V.</small>), call for special notice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_543" id="page_543">{543}</a></span></p>

<p>The town of Aytoun (formerly written Eytun) stands on the river Eye,
about seven miles north from Berwick-on-Tweed, and half a mile from the
railway station.</p>

<p>The old church is situated in an open burial-ground, in connection with
which a new church was erected some years ago. The old building appears,
from the remains of its ivy-covered walls, to have been of considerable
extent, but no details can now be made out. The only portion which
remains in a tolerable state of preservation appears to have formed a
south aisle or wing.</p>

<p>There is a plain segmental headed doorway in the east side, and a large
circular headed window in the south end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1513">1513</a>). The latter is
divided by two mullions into three lights, each finished at the top with
a round-arched head. The window has a transom in the centre. It is
evident from the nature of the design and the form of the mouldings that
the window is of late date, probably of the end of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>Aytoun was granted by the Scottish Edgar to St. Cuthbert’s Monks, and
thus became the property of the Priory of Coldingham, and shared its
fate.</p>

<p>The present church of Ballingry is a modern structure built in 1831. It
stands on the site of a pre-Reformation edifice, which has entirely
disappeared. The window shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1514">1514</a> clearly belongs to the

<p>The walls of this old church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1515">1515</a>) still stand within the grounds
of Blair Castle, the seat of the Duke of Atholl, and about five minutes’
walk from the Castle. The building is roofless and the walls are almost
complete, but they have been much slapped and altered to make the place
suitable for Presbyterian worship.</p>

<p>The masonry is rubble work, built with stones gathered off the hills.
The doors and windows have hewn jambs and lintels of freestone, all
square-headed and splayed. A gravestone, dated 1579, has been built in
the inside of the north wall. The chief interest of the ruin arises from
its containing the vault in which Claverhouse is buried. A tablet on the
inner face of the south wall of the church, west of the aisle which
contains the vault, bears the following inscription:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_545" id="page_545">{545}</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The ruined Church of Boyndie or Inverboyndie stands on a slight
elevation near the mouth of the small river of the same name, about two
miles west from the town of Banff. The parish was formerly conjoined
with Banff till 1634, when it was erected into a separate parish. The
church is of ancient foundation, and was granted in 1211-14, along with
that of Banff, to the monks of Arbroath.</p>

<p>The old church stands in the churchyard, which is still used. It was
abandoned in 1773, when a new church was built. Since that time it has
fallen into complete decay, so much so that the plan cannot now be
properly distinguished. The only portions still preserved in tolerable
condition are the west wall and belfry (Fig. <a href="#fig_1516">1516</a>). These do not appear
to be of great age. The wall contains the entrance doorway of the
church. It has a round arch and jambs with a small splay, such as was
common in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The top of the gable
has a small belfry, which has latterly occupied the position of a former
one, which was much larger. The older belfry must have been of
considerable size, as is apparent from the large corbels which carried
it, and which project<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_546" id="page_546">{546}</a></span> boldly from both sides of the wall. These were
arranged so as to carry an octagonal erection, which must have had a
very picturesque effect.</p>

<h2><a name="ST_MICHAELS_CHURCH_Cupar_Fifeshire" id="ST_MICHAELS_CHURCH_Cupar_Fifeshire"></a>ST. MICHAEL’S CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Cupar, Fifeshire</span>.</h2>

<p>The old Church of Cupar having become decayed, the Prior of St. Andrews,
in 1415, erected a new church on a new site in the town. But in 1785
this church was also found to be in a decayed condition, and was rebuilt
on the same site as that of the fifteenth century. Part of the old
structure at the north-west angle was, however, not destroyed, and still
survives. This portion (Fig. <a href="#fig_1517">1517</a>) comprises three arches of the main or
central nave and the tower at the north-west angle. The latter (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1518">1518</a>) is quadrilateral, and its north and west walls are raised upon the
outer walls of the church at the north-west angle, portions of which
walls still exist, together with the jamb of a large west window. The
tower is unrelieved by buttresses. On the east and south the walls are
carried on arches, the lower story being thus included in the interior
of the church.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_1517" style="width: 320px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1517.</span>&mdash;St. Michael’s Church, Cupar.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The pier at the south-east angle which supports these arches is
hexagonal in form, while the remaining piers of the church are round.
The caps and bases are of the usual late form. The tower is oblong in
plan, being 22 feet from east to west, and 18 feet from north to south.
This inequality produces a peculiar effect in the broached spire which
surmounts it, and which was erected in 1620 by the Rev. William Scott,
the minister of the parish, at his own expense. The balustrade forming
the parapet and the other features of the spire are quite in the
character of the Scottish seventeenth century steeples, common in
Fifeshire, such as those at Anstruther and Pittenweem.</p>

<p>The tower itself is plain with simple pointed lights, those of the upper
story being double, so as to be suitable for the belfry. In the west
wall there occurs a small window with peculiarly shaped head, and below
it the string course is studded with square shaped flowers.</p>

<p>In the present church is preserved a good recumbent effigy (Fig. <a href="#fig_1519">1519</a>)

<p>The old church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1520">1520</a>) forms the eastern part of the structure,
while to the west has been erected a two-story building, containing on
the ground floor a burial vault, and on the upper floor a “laird’s loft”
or room for the Lord of the Manor, from which access was obtained to a
gallery in the church.</p>

<p>The ancient church was dedicated to St. Bridget in 1244. It retains a
simple pointed doorway at the south-west angle, a number of altered and
square-headed windows in the south wall, and a piscina at the east end
of the same wall, but there are scarcely any of the old details
preserved to indicate the date of the building. It has evidently been
greatly altered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_550" id="page_550">{550}</a></span> to make it suitable for Presbyterian worship after the

ashlar work, and the walls are divided into moulded panels in stone work
and a stone cornice runs round the room.</p>

<p>A wide aperture in the east wall of the room opens into the church at a
high level, and no doubt gave access to a gallery at the west end. The
belfry is placed on the west gable of this room and still contains a
small bell, the chain for ringing which has cut a deep groove in the
wall outside. The small room at the south-west angle contains a
fireplace. There has been another gallery at the east end of the church.
The outside staircase for access to it still remains. A good monumental
slab is built into the north wall of the church, bearing date 1540.</p>

<p>The village of Dalry or St. John’s Town stands on the east bank of the
Dee, in the northern or Glenkens district of Kirkcudbrightshire, and is
about ten miles north from Parton Railway Station. The old parish church
was removed in 1829-31, when a new church was erected on the old site.</p>

<p>An old burial vault formerly attached to the church, and known as the
Kenmure burial aisle, has, however, been preserved, which (Fig. <a href="#fig_1523">1523</a>),
with its crow-stepped gable and large antiquely grilled window and
panelled coat of arms, forms an interesting relic of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>This adjunct to the old church formed a projection on its south side,
and measures internally 17 feet in length by 14 feet 2 inches in width
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1524">1524</a>). The entrance from the church, which was about 7 feet wide,
was by a plain rubble archway, which is now built up. The doorway in the
west wall is square-lintelled, and 2 feet 8 inches wide. The window in
the south wall is also square-lintelled, and the iron grill<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_552" id="page_552">{552}</a></span> appears to
have been built in along with the wall. The coat of arms in the panel
over the window is divided in pale, having the three boars’ heads of the
Gordons on the dexter side, and a lion rampant on the sinister side.
These, Mr. Galloway suggests, may be the arms of John Gordon of Kenmure,
who was Justiciar of the Stewartry in 1555, and died in 1604, and who
here combines the provincial with the family arms&mdash;the lion rampant
being the heraldic emblem of the province of Galloway.</p>

9 inches high, and 1 foot 3 inches deep.</p>

the south wall of the old church, a portion of one rybat of a window
having been preserved. Three courses of freestone yet remain, having a
bold splay externally, a groove for glass, and a splayed ingoing. This

<p>These two churches are examples of the revived Gothic architecture of
post-Reformation times. The parish of Drainie was formed by the union of
the two old parishes of Kineddar and Ogstown. They both lie on the
Morayshire coast, about five to six miles north of Elgin, and fully two
miles from Lossiemouth. The country is low lying, and used in former
times to be marshy. Kineddar was a seat of the Bishopric of Moray before
it was moved to Spynie, and ultimately to Elgin. There too stood a large
fortified castle (of the first period), consisting of a great wall of
enceinte surrounded by a deep ditch, but it has now been taken down, and
the plough passes over the site. This castle formed the residence of
some of the Bishops of Moray before Spynie Palace was erected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_554" id="page_554">{554}</a></span></p>

<p>The Church of Drainie was built in 1666, and is a good example of the
period. It has evidently been designed to meet the requirements of the
Presbyterian service of the time (Fig. <a href="#fig_1525">1525</a>). The pulpit would be in the
centre of the south wall, with a window placed on each side of it.
Beyond these, on either hand, are two doors, each admitting to a short
passage, which would give access to a central one. The main body of the
church is 62 feet in length by 24 feet in width, and in the centre of
the north side is a wing 24 feet by 18 feet. This wing or “aisle” is
spanned by a stone arch, which may have carried a gallery above, to
light which a small window is introduced in the north gable. The ground
floor of the north wing would be seated in the usual manner, and is
provided with an entrance door and two windows. Similar arrangements of
plan are common in the Scottish churches of post-Reformation times.</p>

<p>The windows and doors (Fig. <a href="#fig_1526">1526</a>) have pointed arches, and the windows
are each divided by one mullion, which branches into two in the
arch-head. These door and window dressings are all chamfered on the
edges. The cornice is of classic form, and the gables are crow-stepped.
The west gable is finished on top with an ornamental belfry in the
Renaissance style of the period, in which some revival of Gothic
features was attempted.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find in the neighbourhood of Cape Wrath a specimen
of ecclesiastical architecture, even though of the seventeenth century.
The old parish church, which is now a ruin, occupies the site of a cell
of Dornoch monastery. It was built in 1619. The Plan (Fig. <a href="#fig_1531">1531</a>) is
somewhat irregular, but not unlike, in general form, to many of the
churches of Scotland at the same period, having the pulpit placed in the
centre of the long side wall, and facing the wing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_558" id="page_558">{558}</a></span></p>

<p>This edifice was the parish church of East Calder till 1750, when a new
church was erected at Kirknewton, and East Calder was united with that
parish. These two parishes lie about ten miles west from Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The Church of East Calder was dedicated to St. Cuthbert. At the
accession of William the Lion the church was granted to the monks of
Kelso. This parish was formerly called Calder-Clere, to distinguish it

</div>

<p>Mid-Calder, which lies about one mile west of it, on the opposite side
of the river Almond. The church, which is now a ruin, stands in its old
churchyard. It is a simple oblong (Fig. <a href="#fig_1533">1533</a>), internally 56 feet in
length by 17 feet in width. The north wall has been removed, and the
interior divided into burial-places, separated by walls and railings.
The doorways and windows have been built up, and few of the wall
openings can now be seen. One window is still partly preserved in the
east end (Fig. <a href="#fig_1534">1534</a>). It has evidently been divided into two lights by a
mullion, which is removed, and each light has had a round-arched head.
Another window<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_560" id="page_560">{560}</a></span> in the south wall, near the east end, is of similar
form. The mullion and round heads of the opening have been preserved by
being built up. A doorway, also built up, adjoins the window in the
south wall on the west.</p>

<p>There may be other built up openings, but the wall is so thickly covered
with ivy that they cannot be identified. The belfry on the west gable is
plain, and evidently late in date. The few details which survive
indicate a post-Reformation style, probably of about 1600.</p>

<p>Two ruined parish churches, each in its churchyard, situated within two
miles of each other and about nine miles south-west of Forfar. They are
small buildings, measuring respectively 56 feet 6 inches by 15 feet 6
inches, and 53 feet 6 inches by 18 feet 6 inches within the walls (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1535">1535</a>). Neither church has any openings in the north wall. At Eassie
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1536">1536</a>) all the doors and windows are square-headed, and at Nevay
they are the same, except that the west doorway is round-headed, but not
arched, being cut out of one stone. At Eassie the westmost doorway on
the south side is of eighteenth century work, but the eastmost one is
original. An ivy-mantled belfry crowns the west end of each edifice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_561" id="page_561">{561}</a></span></p>

<p>The annexed sketch (Fig. <a href="#fig_1537">1537</a>) shows the old pulpit of St. Cuthbert’s
Church as it stood in St. Cuthbert’s Poorhouse, Lothian Road, Edinburgh,
before that building was removed in 1868. It appears<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> that when St.
Cuthbert’s Church was demolished in 1773, the pulpit was transferred to
the Poorhouse. Its date can be pretty well ascertained. From a minute of
the kirk-session of 15th August 1651, we find that Cromwell’s soldiers
had so completely sacked the church that there was “nayther pulpit,
loft, nor seat left therein,” all doors and windows having been broken,
and the roof by cannon shot completely ruined. Steps were immediately
taken to repair the damage, and in April 1652 the church was reopened
for public worship. This pulpit was doubtless made between the above
dates, and its style is characteristic of the time. It is of oak, and
probably in the old church it stood on a loftier base than is shown in
the sketch.</p>

<p>The parish of Fetteresso included a considerable part of the town of
Stonehaven on the east coast of Kincardineshire. The old church, the
ruins of which stand in a large churchyard, is situated near the Carron
Water, about one mile and a half south-west from Stonehaven. The
structure probably occupies the site of a very ancient church, dedicated
to St. Cavan, which stood at the Hamlet of Fetteresso. It is beautifully
situated amongst fine old trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_563" id="page_563">{563}</a></span></p>

date of 1720. A small adjunct to the west of the wing carries the date
of 1857.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_565" id="page_565">{565}</a></span> The wall openings are almost entirely in the south wall, in
which there are three doorways and six windows. There is one window in
the east end and one pointed doorway in the north wall. The north wing
contains a north doorway and two windows in the east wall. This wing,
doubtless, contained a gallery. The openings in the south wall are all
built up, and the interior is converted into a private burial-ground.
The details have all the character of eighteenth century work. The
belfry (Fig. <a href="#fig_1539">1539</a>) stands on the top of the west gable and still retains
its bell, which is used on the occasion of funerals. The church and its
surroundings are very picturesque.</p>

<p>The structure bears the mark of the period when it was erected in the
mixed style of its architecture, being partly an imitation of Gothic and
partly Renaissance. It measures (Fig. <a href="#fig_1540">1540</a>) about 40 feet in length by
16 feet in width internally, and is a simple oblong in plan, with a
doorway in the centre of the south side. It is lighted (Fig. <a href="#fig_1541">1541</a>) by

of the north side, and a large three-light window at each end. The
windows are divided by mullions, and have a species of tracery in the

<p class="nind">has been built at two periods. The east end is the earliest part. The
total length of the church internally (Fig. <a href="#fig_1544">1544</a>) is about 94 feet 4
inches by 15 feet 6 inches wide. The later part of the structure is
about 10 inches wider than the earlier, the walls being thinner. The
external<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_568" id="page_568">{568}</a></span> dimensions are 96 feet long by 21 feet 8 inches wide. The
chancel or east end was probably heightened at the time when the west
end was built. The east gable has a sett-off at the level of what was
apparently the original height (Fig. <a href="#fig_1545">1545</a>). There are two doors on the
south side, that in the chancel being lintelled and having a hole for a
sliding bar, while the other in the nave is round arched, as is also a
door in the opposite wall. These doors have all beaded mouldings. There
is only one window on the north side. On the south side the windows are
of various sizes, and are scattered about in an irregular way. Two of
them, which are placed high in the wall, are checked for outside
shutters; the others have all simple splays.</p>

<p>There is a plain ambry in the east wall at a high level, and adjoining
it in the north wall there is a recess, probably a <i>credence</i>, as
suggested by the Rev. Dr. Pratt.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> This part of the building is in a
neglected condition, being fitted up as a toolhouse for the
gravedigger’s implements. There is built into the interior of the east
gable a memorial tablet, with very quaintly carved letters and
mouldings, to the memory of Patricius Barclay dominus de Tolly, and his
wife, Joneta Ogilvy, who died in 1547.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> There were other interesting
memorials connected with the church which are referred to by Dr. Pratt,
but of these only mutilated fragments remain. The indignant remonstrance
of the Rev. Dr. against the condition of the building, written thirty
years ago, backed up by a poem by Principal Geddes, has not availed to
secure any respect for the old walls.</p>

<p>The Church of Gamrie is frequently referred to in the twelfth and

to the Church of Gamrie by the Abbot of Arbroath. Probably the existing
walls were erected about the latter date, but the details indicate that
great alterations have been made on the building, which convert it into
a seventeenth century structure.</p>

north side about 24 feet square, opening into the church by the wide and
lofty arch seen in the view. This arch, which is simply splayed on both
faces, has two of its voussoirs projected about 6 inches beyond the
others. These may have been rests for diagonal pieces to carry the
continuation of the roof at the arch. A sundial (Fig. <a href="#fig_1547">1547</a>), bearing the

<h2><a name="THE_TRON_STEEPLE_Glasgow" id="THE_TRON_STEEPLE_Glasgow"></a>THE TRON STEEPLE, <span class="smcap">Glasgow</span>.</h2>

<p>This tower, with its spire, stands in the Trongate, the most crowded
thoroughfare of the city of Glasgow, and, as will be seen (Fig. <a href="#fig_1548">1548</a>),
it projects on to the street. It is believed that it is in contemplation
to remove it; and as the old college buildings were got rid of a few
years ago without much regret being expressed, the removal of a small
steeple like this will, doubtless, be regarded as a very simple matter.
Yet its destruction will deprive us of a very interesting example of a
genuine seventeenth century spire, of which few were erected or now
survive in Scotland. This steeple was erected in 1637. It has clearly
been built in imitation of that of the cathedral, having similar
features translated into the style of its time, and with rather a happy
effect.</p>

<p>The steeple was attached to a church of older date, which was burned
down in 1793. This was the Collegiate Church of St. Thenaw, which was
erected in 1525, with the consent of the archbishop, Gavin Dunbar.</p>

<p>From the proximity of the public weighing machine or Tron to the church,
it gradually came to be known as the Tron Church, and latterly the
instrument itself stood in the ground floor of the steeple, which was
then enclosed with solid walls. About forty years ago the Tron was
removed, and the ground floor of the building was opened up to form an
open passage along the street pavement. The wide arches on the street
floor are thus modern.</p>

<h2><a name="GRANDTULLY_CHAPEL_Perthshire238" id="GRANDTULLY_CHAPEL_Perthshire238"></a>GRANDTULLY CHAPEL, <span class="smcap">Perthshire</span>.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></h2>

<p>This chapel stands a little to the east of Grandtully Castle at a place
called Pitcairn (anciently Petquharne), about three miles from
Aberfeldy. It is situated at a considerable height above the valley of
Strathtay, and commands an extensive view of mountain scenery. Any one
seeing the chapel for the first time, and unacquainted with its
existence, might easily mistake it for part of the adjoining farm
buildings, it is so plain and humble in appearance. Only the presence of
the churchyard surrounding it, and a very small cross on the east gable,
serve to call attention to the fact that it is a sacred edifice, which
on inspection is found to possess features of considerable interest.</p>

<p>The building (Fig. <a href="#fig_1549">1549</a>) may be said to be entire in walls and roof. It
measures on the outside about 79 feet long by about 23 feet 3 inches
wide, and is at present divided into two parts by a stone partition.</p>

<p>There are two doors and several small windows on the south side. These
openings are all straight lintelled and quite unadorned. A door on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_572" id="page_572">{572}</a></span> the
north side is probably modern. There is a small locker, 14 or 15 inches
square, in the usual position in the north wall near the east end. This
ambry, which is about four feet from the floor, is of great interest, as
it is quite entire, having a wooden door and hinges, an almost unknown
condition in Scotland. There is another small recess about 17 inches
square and about 3 feet from the ground in the east wall. But the
principal feature of the chapel, and what renders it almost unique, is
the</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">painted ceiling at the east end. This ceiling is constructed, as shown
on the sketch (Fig. <a href="#fig_1550">1550</a>), at the west end of the eastern division. The
roof consists of rafters and ties, on which, at the east end, boards are
fixed so as to present a circular form, in the same way as in several of
the other painted ceilings of Scottish castles and mansions, such as
Pinkie, Culross, and Earl’s Hall. It is not known whether this painted
roof extended the whole length of the chapel or was confined, as it now
is, to the east end. The painting presents four rows of circular discs,
each containing six circles, which are variously ornamented. Four of
them are occupied with the four Evangelists, and others with coats of
arms, including the royal arms&mdash;1st and 4th, Scotland; 2nd, England;
3rd, Ireland, with an inner-escutcheon. The arms of England and Scotland
also occur on separate shields, as well as those of the Earls of Athole
and of the Laird of Grandtully and his wife, Dame Agnes Moncrieff. The
paintings were rather exposed for some years to damp, and in many places
the subjects and inscriptions, which are numerous, are considerably
effaced; but further decay is arrested by the roof having recently been
put in good order. Amongst the paintings there are complicated
monograms, and a large panel in the centre contains an elaborate
composition showing buildings with quaint figures.</p>

<p>This chapel is first noticed in a “Notarial instrument, recording sasine
given by Alexander Steuart of Garntulye, from devotion and with the view
of promoting divine worship” of certain lands, “in terms of a charter to
be made, to Alexander Young, sub-prior of St. Andrews, as representing
the curate who is to officiate at the chapel built near the manor-place
of Petquharne, and to be consecrated to God, the Virgin Mary, St. Andrew
the Apostle, St. Adamnanus and St. Beanus. Dated 9th May 1533.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_573" id="page_573">{573}</a></span></p>

<p>Following this, in the 3rd June of the same year, is the charter
referred to conveying the land and privileges to the church and to a
chaplain, “who was to be a suitable curate, personally residing and
celebrating divine worship and the sacraments irreproachably in the
Church of St. Mary of Grantulye.” The church was “to be held for prayers
to be made by the</p>

and his kingdom, the granter’s own soul, and the souls of certain of his

<p>This gives us the period of the erection of the church, but the painting
is later, being shown by the style and by the arms to have been done by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_574" id="page_574">{574}</a></span>
Sir William Steuart about the year 1636. Sir William was an intimate
friend from childhood of King James <small>VI.</small>, and was by him greatly beloved.
He married Agnes Moncrieff, daughter of Sir John of that Ilk, and, as
already mentioned, their arms are on the ceiling, and their initials are
also carved over a small window in the east gable.</p>

well with the ancient tower. The latter (Fig. <a href="#fig_1551">1551</a>), which is a part of
an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_575" id="page_575">{575}</a></span> earlier church, is an interesting example of a Scottish church
tower. It is quite plain in its lower stages, and has a corbelled out
parapet at the top, which is reached by a stair in the projecting
turret, seen in the sketch. The tower is a place of considerable
strength, being vaulted on the ground floor, and is probably a building
of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The manor of Greenlaw belonged to the Earls of Dunbar and Gospatrick,
and the third Earl granted the church, in 1159, to the Abbey of Kelso.
Greenlaw was one of the churches dedicated by Bishop David de Bernham.</p>

<p>The old church of Kinnoull stood on the east side of the Tay opposite
Perth. It may be said to have entirely disappeared with the exception of
an aisle which was attached to the church, and now contains a
seventeenth century monument to the Earl of Kinnoull (Fig. <a href="#fig_1558">1558</a>). The
monument is of a pompous kind, and inspires none of those feelings of
reverence begotten by the monuments of the Middle Ages. It occupies the
full width and height of the aisle, and has a high dado richly
sculptured on the pedestals and sides with arms and insignia of power,
and contains an ornate central panel. From the dado there rise three
columns resting on pedestals. The columns themselves are twisted and
carved. The capitals, which are in imitation of Corinthian, are very
debased. The two end columns are backed by projecting pilasters at the
wall. Above the columns there runs a carved entablature with cornice,
supporting, by way of finish, a heraldic slab in the centre, with
various separate figures on each side of it.</p>

<p>The principal feature of the monument, to which all the above are
accessories, is the life-sized statue of George, first Earl of Kinnoull

<p>The small town of Lauder stands in the wide and fertile vale of the
Leader Water, about six miles (over a high hill) from the nearest
railway station at Stow. The ancient parish church of Lauder was
bestowed, in the reign of David i., on Sir Hugh Morville, Constable of
Scotland. It was afterwards given by Devorgilla, wife of John Baliol, to
Dryburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_583" id="page_583">{583}</a></span> Abbey, to which it remained attached till the Reformation. It
appears that there were two chapels connected with the parish church in
different parts of the parish.</p>

<p>The existing parish church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1560">1560</a>) stands in the ancient churchyard.
It has apparently been entirely rebuilt in 1673, which date is carved on
the north gable. Chalmers, however, says that the ancient church was
relinquished in 1617, when a new church was erected. The present
structure, although very late, shows some reminiscences of Gothic forms,
both in its plan and elevations.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1560.</span>&mdash;Lauder Church. Plan.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The plan is a Greek cross having four equal arms extending from a
central crossing. The latter is 14 feet square, and each arm is 28 feet
6 inches in length by 16 feet in width internally. The crossing is
surmounted by four pointed arches, which spring from a massive pier at
each angle, and carry the central tower. In the north-west and
south-east angles of the arms there are introduced two entrance lobbies,
giving access to the four arms and to staircases, leading to a gallery
in each arm. The space on the ground floor below the galleries is low,
and is lighted by two square windows in the end wall of each arm (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1561">1561</a>), with moulded jambs and lintel, while each upper floor or gallery
is lighted by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_584" id="page_584">{584}</a></span> a large pointed window in the gable, filled with
plain intersecting tracery, with mullions and transoms.</p>

<p>The entrance doorways have round arches with hood moulding, and the side
windows of the staircases are pointed. The external angles of the
building and the outline of the windows are all finished with a broad
fillet, projected so as to receive rough casting. The skews of the
gables are plain and do not project, and the joints are horizontal. Each
skew has a large projecting stone at bottom. These appear to have
carried small pyramidal ornaments, two of which are still preserved.</p>

<p>The central tower is square till it reaches the ridge of the main roofs,
above which point it becomes octagonal, and is finished with a slated
roof. A small round-headed window of a late style is inserted in four
sides of the octagonal part or belfry.</p>

<p>The staircase buildings in the two angles do not appear to be parts of
the original structure, or at least would seem to have been a good deal
altered.</p>

attempted introduction in the seventeenth century of Episcopacy into
Scotland. It seems not unlikely that the quasi-Gothic character of the

<p>A ruined church, the predecessor of the present one, which was built
early in this century. It stands about four miles west from Stranraer.
All the dressed stones of the wall openings have been taken out, so that
nothing remains to tell the date of the structure. In the seventeenth
century a wing (Fig. <a href="#fig_1562">1562</a>) has been erected against the north wall,
which probably contained a gallery above and a burial-place below, as
was frequently the case in similar erections about that time. The wall
between the wing and the church is still standing several feet high.</p>

<p>The wing has been entered by a plain flat lintelled door in the north
wall (Fig. <a href="#fig_1563">1563</a>), over which is a window divided into four compartments
by a moulded mullion and transom. This window would light the private
room or gallery on the upper floor. A panel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1564">1564</a>) below the window
shows that the place was used as a burial vault, as it contains an
inscription and two coats of arms. The inscription states that it is in
memory of Patritus Agnew of Lochnaw, Earl of Wigton, and Margaret
Kennedy, his spouse; <small>A.D.</small> 1644. The arms on the shields beneath are
those of Agnew and Kennedy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_586" id="page_586">{586}</a></span></p>

<p>Some good fragments of old woodwork survive in the church, particularly
a pulpit (Fig. <a href="#fig_1573">1573</a>), which, it is usually stated, was made in Holland.
Lyne is distant from the sea and must have been difficult of access; for
which reason, amongst others, we doubt whether there is any truth in the
tradition. The pulpit, which is circular in plan, is quite simple in
design, and its construction would not present a formidable task to a
Scottish country wright, judging by other examples of woodwork made in
Scotland about this time. Some of the other woodwork bears the date
1644, and one of the pews, now removed, was dated 1606.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The church
has been frequently repaired, which accounts for the loss of such
examples.</p>

Stobo.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Robert, the chaplain of Lyne, is a witness to a charter in
the Register of Glasgow, between 1208 and 1213; but of the early church
then existing nothing now remains, the present structure probably dating
from the beginning of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>A retired parish church about four miles east from Haddington. It is
stated to have been built in 1724, but some portions of ornamental
carving built into the south wall (Fig. <a href="#fig_1574">1574</a>) would seem to indicate
that they had formed part of an earlier structure.</p>

<p>A ruined church standing in the centre of an ancient churchyard,
situated about three miles south-east from Aberdeen. The church is
probably one of those built during the short period of Episcopal
government in the seventeenth century. It consists (Fig. <a href="#fig_1576">1576</a>) of a
single chamber, but there are indications of an arch across from side to
side, where shown by dotted lines on the Plan, which may have marked a
chancel. The building is 48 feet 6 inches in length by 20 feet 6 inches
in width internally, and has been roofless for more than half a
century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_593" id="page_593">{593}</a></span></p>

<p>The lintelled door is on the south side, and there are two other doors
on the north side, one of them being in the supposed chancel.</p>

<p>The belfry (Fig. <a href="#fig_1577">1577</a>) appears to have been rebuilt in 1703. A row of
projecting corbels, which probably supported a previous belfry, are left
projecting under the new one.</p>

<p>Immediately adjoining the ruin there is a stately seventeenth century
house, formerly the manse, now occupied by an agricultural tenant and
farm labourers.</p>

<p>The building is on the site of an early church, which was granted by
William the Lion to his favourite Abbey of Arbroath, and it remained as
one of its dependaries till the Reformation.</p>

<h2><a name="OLDHAMSTOCKS_CHURCH_Berwickshire" id="OLDHAMSTOCKS_CHURCH_Berwickshire"></a>OLDHAMSTOCKS CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Berwickshire</span>.</h2>

<p>The main portion of this church, although its walls may in part be old,
is not of much architectural merit, but the chancel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1578">1578</a>) is not
without interest as a specimen of late Gothic work. It is now used as a
burial vault, and is completely ivy clad. It measures about 18 or 20
feet square, and is of modest height, being some 10 or 12 feet to the
eaves.</p>

<p>The chief feature is the east window, with its rude tracery. The latter,
which is of a different stone from the jambs and sills, is probably a
restoration of late in the sixteenth century, while the chancel itself
may be a little earlier. The building is vaulted with a barrel vault,
and is covered on the exterior with overlapping stone slabs. It is
impossible to say whether it contains any features of pre-Reformation
times. The door seen on the south side of the choir is dated 1701.</p>

<p>Of the panels half concealed in the ivy, the one on the right contains
the arms of Thomas Hepburn, incumbent of Oldhamstocks, and of his wife,
Margaret Sinclair, who died in 1581. This Thomas Hepburn was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_595" id="page_595">{595}</a></span> admitted

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1578.</span>&mdash;Oldhamstocks Church.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This church is of an old foundation. In 1127 Aldulph, the presbyter of
Aldehamstoc, witnessed a charter of Robert, the Bishop of St. Andrews,
and the church is rated in the ancient <i>Taxatio</i> and in <i>Bagimond’s
Roll</i>. It is also recorded as an existing rectory in the Archbishop’s
Roll of 1547.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_596" id="page_596">{596}</a></span></p>

<p>There is a peculiar sundial on the south-west corner of the church,
which is illustrated.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> It may be mentioned that in the centre of the
west end of the church there is a tower which is finished at the top
with a modern belfry. This tower or turret is probably of
pre-Reformation date.</p>

<h2><a name="ORMISTON_CHURCH_Haddingtonshire" id="ORMISTON_CHURCH_Haddingtonshire"></a>ORMISTON CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Haddingtonshire</span>.</h2>

<p>Only a small portion of the old church of Ormiston, in which Wishart and
Knox more than once officiated, has been preserved. It stands close to
the mansion house of Ormiston Hall, about one mile south from the
village of Ormiston. A new church having been erected about a quarter of
a mile distant, the old church has been allowed to go to decay. The
surviving fragment of the latter appears to have been the east end.
There are several stones built into the walls which must have belonged
to a Norman church, being carved with the chevron ornament.</p>

<p>The Church of Ormiston was dedicated to St. Giles. It was granted to the
Hospital of Soltre, founded by Malcolm <small>IV.</small>, which was confirmed by the
Bishop of St. Andrews in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>This church was subsequently made a prebend of the Church of the Holy
Trinity at Edinburgh, founded by Mary of Gueldres.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1579.</span>&mdash;Ormiston Church. Plan.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The building (Fig. <a href="#fig_1579">1579</a>) has been enclosed at the west end with a modern
wall, and measures, within the enclosure, 16 feet 6 inches in length by
13 feet 6 inches in width. It contains in the south wall the outlines of
two windows, now built up, and of one window in the north wall. These
have apparently been altered at some time and made square-headed. An
archway of considerable height (Fig. <a href="#fig_1580">1580</a>) stands in the continuation of
the south wall westwards. It is in two orders, the outer order square<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_597" id="page_597">{597}</a></span>
and the inner order splayed. This doorway has apparently entered into
the church, which, judging from the height of the archway, must have had
side walls of considerable height. They are now reduced as shown, and a
roof was put upon the east portion during this century, which renders
the interior very dark.</p>

<p>In the north wall of the chancel there is a monument of some importance
(Fig. <a href="#fig_1581">1581</a>), as it contains one of the few brasses which exist in
Scotland. The brass consists of an engraved plate containing an
inscription to the memory of Alexander Cockburn, one of the members of
the family to whom the adjoining mansion house belonged. He died, as the
inscription tells, at an early age. The upper part of the inscription is
metrical, and was composed by the learned George Buchanan, and</p>

</div>

<p class="nind">appears in his published works. Alexander Cockburn was a pupil of John
Knox, and in 1547 sought refuge in the Castle of St. Andrews. On the
dexter base of the brass are engraved the Cockburn arms, and on the
sinister base the arms of Sandilands, for the mother of a Cockburn, who
was of the family of Sandilands of Calder. These arms are quartered with
the arms of Douglas, and show the ancient relationship between that
family and the Sandilands.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>The barony of Ormiston was the property of the Cockburns from the middle
of the fourteenth century, when they acquired it by marriage.</p>

<p>The monument was no doubt erected not long after the death of the person
commemorated, or towards the end of the sixteenth century. It
corresponds in style with that of the Regent Murray, in St. Giles’
Cathedral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_598" id="page_598">{598}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="PITTENWEEM_PRIORY_Fifeshire" id="PITTENWEEM_PRIORY_Fifeshire"></a>PITTENWEEM PRIORY, <span class="smcap">Fifeshire</span>.</h2>

<p>Of the old monastery of Pittenweem, which was connected with that on the
Isle of May in the Frith of Forth, only some altered fragments survive.
The priory seems to have derived its name from its being built close to
a cave or “weem” on the shore of the Frith of Forth, with which it had
communication by a vaulted chamber in the garden and a long straight
staircase. The monastic buildings surrounded a courtyard. On the south
side was the prior’s mansion (now restored and occupied by the Episcopal
clergyman of the place). On the west side was the refectory, now
converted into the Town Hall, and to the north of it the dormitories.</p>

<p>Some of the walls of these structures still exist, with two square
projecting windows overlooking the courtyard. On the east side is the
gatehouse, a battlemented structure with a round archway passing through
it, now greatly decayed and covered with ivy. Beyond the courtyard to
the north lay some outer grounds and a chapel.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_600" id="page_600">{600}</a></span></p>

<p>After the Reformation the buildings passed into the hands of laymen, and
the monastery became the “manor place of Pittenweem.” In 1588 a portion
of the grounds was granted to the burgh, in order that a suitable church
might be erected, which was carried out soon thereafter (Fig. <a href="#fig_1582">1582</a>).
Possibly some portions of the church of the priory are included in this
building, but it has in recent years been restored and extended.</p>

<p>The quaint tower (Fig. <a href="#fig_1583">1583</a>), with its mixture of Gothic and classic
features, is the only part which has not been interfered with. The
tower, which stands at the north-west angle of the church, is about 18
feet square externally. It rises with a plain square outline for a
considerable way without buttresses or anything to distinguish it from a
castle keep. There are even shot-holes under the windows, as in the
domestic structures of the time. The stair turret in the north-east
angle has the outline and corbelled gablet similar to the cape-house of
the stair turrets of the Scotch castles of the period. The spire, with
its remarkable lucarnes, helps to give the erection a little more of an
ecclesiastical character, but the balustrade again recalls the attention
to the domestic and Renaissance style of the design.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>This church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1584">1584</a>) was reconstructed in 1703, and is believed to
rest on the foundations of an older structure, dedicated by Bishop
Bernham in 1242. The building measures 55 feet by 24 feet over the
walls. Although of such a late date, it is of pleasing form, and has
fine large mouldings round the doors and panels above them. A stone on
the east gable contains the Polwarth arms, three piles engrailed.</p>

<p>The font of the old church stands outside the building. It is of a round
form 28 inches in diameter. The basin, which is 22 inches in diameter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_602" id="page_602">{602}</a></span></p>

<p>This panel (Fig. <a href="#fig_1585">1585</a>) was discovered in 1891 during some alterations of
the seating of the church. It then formed the back of a seat in the
gallery, and was concealed by a green cloth. Doubtless, from its
heraldic decorations, it must originally have occupied a more prominent
position. The arms and initials show that it belonged to the Hamiltons
of Preston. The date on the panel (1604) connects it with an earlier
church, the present church having been erected later. The panel is of
oak and in good preservation, except where cut away to make it fit its
new position, and the colours are still rich and fresh. The panel is in
two pieces, each 2 feet 3 inches high. The whole is divided into eight
compartments, of which only four bear arms. They are all arched, and are
separated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_603" id="page_603">{603}</a></span></p>

Cockburn, his wife, are carved in relief in the spandrils. The letters
painted within the arches, viz.,<small>S/J. H.</small> and <small>D./K. H.</small> stand for Sir John
Hamilton, the son of the above, and Dame Katherine Howieson, his second
wife, married 1620. The lady died 1629. The shields beneath these
initials contain the Hamilton arms twice, and the Cockburn and Howieson
arms for the wives of the father and son. The initials of the son and
his wife were carved over the windows of the tower, while over the
centre window they appear in a monogram with the date 1626.</p>

which survive in Scotland, is now in the possession of General Sir

<p>The Church of Rathan was dedicated to St. Ethernan or Eddran, from whom
the place is said to take its name. This saint lived towards the end of
the sixth century. “He consecrated several churches, and particularly
Rethin, which was afterwards dedicated to his own memory.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Richard, parson of Rathen, is a witness to charters by Adam, Bishop of
Aberdeen, between 1207 and 1228, and the benefice of Rathyn was given to
the Chapter and College of Canons of St. Machar’s Cathedral by Robert i.
in 1328; and in 1520 Rathyne was let in lease for the yearly rent of
£212.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>About one mile south from the railway station of Fairlie, on the level

<p class="nind">has been a considerable range of dwelling-house accommodation, two
stories in height, along the north side, and smaller buildings on the
east side, leaving a large courtyard in the centre, now forming the
garden of the adjoining farmhouse (Fig. <a href="#fig_1593">1593</a>). The situation is fine,
and the edifice is backed by the high range of thickly wooded hills
which extends between Largs and Kilbride.</p>

<p>The lands of Southannan were granted to Lord Semple in 1504. Chalmers
says<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> that John, Lord Semple, in the reign of James <small>IV.</small>, built<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_608" id="page_608">{608}</a></span> a
chapel, which was dedicated to St. Annan or St. Ennan, and granted for

Inan or Innan is said to have been a confessor at Irvine, and to have
died in 839.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_609" id="page_609">{609}</a></span></p>

<p>The castle was much enlarged by Robert, fourth Lord Sempill, ambassador
to the Court of Spain in 1596; but some of the existing remains have the
appearance of being still more modern. The old mansion was dismantled
towards the end of last century, and the materials used in the erection
of farm-buildings and dykes. “What remains are chiefly the outer walls
to the left (north) of the courtyard and some more ancient-looking
remnants at the back (east), attached to which are remains of what may
have been the chapel of the saint.”<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> This may be the case, as some
of the walls are old and have been altered; but the vaulted chamber to
the east has the appearance of being much more modern.</p>

<p>On the whole, we fear that the chapel has entirely disappeared, and that
this account of Southannan should rather have appeared amongst the
castles than the churches of Scotland.</p>

stands (Fig. <a href="#fig_1599">1599</a>), consists of an oblong 67 feet in length by 21 feet
in width internally, with a wing on the south side 14 feet long by 11
feet wide within the walls.</p>

<p>The principal oblong chamber appears to have been constructed at two
different times, there being a break in the interior of the wall at 20
feet from the east end. There is also a slight exterior projection on
the outside of the north wall at the same point. The eastern addition
has evidently been made so as to provide a gallery, probably a private
one, at this end. The gallery was entered by a long slope or ramp on the
exterior of the east wall, beneath which was a door giving access to the
space below the gallery. The gallery and space below were lighted by
square-headed windows in the south wall. On the jamb of the east doorway
is carved the date 1799.</p>

<p>The arrangements at the west end have been similar to those at the east
end. There was a gallery, lighted by a large traceried window (Fig.
<a href="#fig_1600">1600</a>) in the west wall of seventeenth century design, and the space
below the gallery had two square-headed windows in the same wall,
divided with mullions. A round-headed doorway in the south wall gave</p>

<a href="#fig_1601">1601</a>) clearly indicate a late date. Adjoining this doorway is the
portion of the structure above alluded to as being of ancient date. This
consists of a plain buttress built with freestone ashlar, and a small
part of the south and west walls connected with it, including a base
splay on the south side. These walls are built with the same kind of
materials as the buttress, while the greater part of the walls are
constructed with rubble work. The buttress has the broad form with small
projection, and the simple water table of Norman or transition work.</p>

<p>The projection or “aisle” on the south side of the church has also
contained a private gallery, with a fireplace in the south wall. The
mouldings of the doorway indicate seventeenth or eighteenth century
work.</p>

<p>There are no windows in the north wall, but some portions of the masonry
are of ashlar work and may be of the period of the south-west angle.</p>

<p>The belfry, the vane of which bears the date of 1794, is a comparatively
late addition. It is supported on corbels projecting from the inside of
the wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_614" id="page_614">{614}</a></span></p>

Herries shortly before his death in 1583.</p>

<p>A few years ago this “queir” or choir was completely restored, and the

<p>This ancient church, which was dedicated to St. Congan, is a very old
foundation, having probably been established, in the seventh century, by
a follower of St. Columba. It received donations at various early dates,
amongst others one by King Robert the Bruce. In 1272 it was attached by
the Earl of Buchan to an almshouse for thirteen poor husbandmen. The
church was 120 feet long by 18 feet wide, but is now reduced to the
fragment of the choir, crowned with the picturesque belfry shown by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_616" id="page_616">{616}</a></span>

<h2><a name="WALSTON_CHURCH_Lanarkshire" id="WALSTON_CHURCH_Lanarkshire"></a>WALSTON CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Lanarkshire</span>.</h2>

<p>The parish church of Walston stands on a height overlooking the vale of
the river Medwin, about two miles west from Dolphinton. Till near the
end of the thirteenth century the Church of Walston was a lay rectory in
the gift of the Lord of the Manor. It is specially referred to in an
award of 1293.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> The edifice stands in an ancient churchyard, and not
far from what was formerly a mansion known as the “Place of Walston.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1607.</span>&mdash;Walston Church. Plan.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The existing church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1607">1607</a>) stands north and south, and is a long
single chamber 64 feet 6 inches in length and 16 feet in width
internally. A portion has been cut off the north end to form a vestry.
The original church is believed to have stood east and west. At the
south end a portion of the existing structure is evidently, from its
workmanship, of a different period from the remainder. The ashlar work
of which it is built is seen to stop beyond the first window from the
south (Fig. <a href="#fig_1608">1608</a>). This was doubtless the wing or transept erected by
Robert Baillie of Walston, in 1650, as a burial-place for his family.
The remainder of the church was rebuilt in its new position in
continuation of the south wing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_618" id="page_618">{618}</a></span> by the Rev. Patrick Molleson, minister
(born 1746, died 1825), who has placed the letters M. P. M. and the date
1789 on the north gable.</p>

<p>The south wing is the only part worthy of notice. The window shows the
feeling for the Gothic revival of the seventeenth century. In the panel
over it is the inscription “Give God the onlie honour and glory.</p>

<p>Anno 1656.” The entrance doorway to the wing, which contained a tomb
below and a gallery above, is in the east side. Over the flat lintelled
door is the quotation, “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the House of
God, and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of
fools.&mdash;Ecclesiastes, chapter <small>V.</small>, verse 1.” The tomb and gallery are now
removed, and the space thrown into the church. In the pavement on the
site is inscribed “In memory of John Allain, Esq., of Elsrickle.” The
quaint dormer window, shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1609">1609</a>, was taken down during the
repairs made on the church a few years ago.</p>

<p>WEEM CHURCH, <span class="smcap">Perthshire</span>.[262]</p>

<p>The ruined church of Weem stands in the village of that name, near the
entrance to Castle Menzies, at a short distance from Aberfeldy. It is
still in a fair state of preservation, the walls being entire, although
greatly overgrown with ivy, and the roof being still intact, with the
belfry on the west gable. The building has been abandoned for many
years. According to Mr. A. H. Millar<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> the Church of Weem is
mentioned about 1296 in the oldest charter at Castle Menzies, and
references in charters are continuous till, in 1510, the Barony of
Menzies was erected by charter from James <small>IV.</small>, when “the patronage of
the Kirk of Weem was specially included in the gift.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1610.</span>&mdash;Weem Church. Inscription over East Doorway.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The existing building, however, appears to be of a later date, since
over the eastmost doorway there are the impaled arms of Sir Alexander
Menzies and his wife, Margaret Campbell, with their initials, and the
date 1600, together with the inscription shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1610">1610</a>.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>The church (Fig. <a href="#fig_1611">1611</a>) is an oblong building, measuring internally about
62 feet 5 inches from east to west by about 19 feet wide, and has a
north transept projecting 21 feet by 17 feet in width. It is ceiled and
plastered at the roof ties. There are two doors and three windows on the
south side, all of which are square headed. In each gable, high up near
the ceiling, there is a window of a pointed form. All the windows and
doors have large bead mouldings. In the inside of the south wall there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_620" id="page_620">{620}</a></span>
are two ambries, one of which contains the initials of Duncan Menzies
and his wife, Jean Leslie, sister of the Earl of Rothes, who were
married in 1623. And on the other occur the initials D. M.</p>

<p>There are several interesting grave slabs in the church, but the most
remarkable feature is the monument shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_1612">1612</a>, which stands
against the north wall near the east end, as indicated on the Plan. It
is an important example of Scottish Renaissance work, and contains a
great amount of detail, much of it very elaborate.</p>

<p>The sixteenth or seventeenth century monuments in Scotland may be
divided into two classes, viz.:&mdash;First, the class represented by the
Montgomery monument at Largs,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and the seventeenth century monument
in Seton Church, which are almost pure Italian, with very little of the
previous Gothic manner, and almost nothing of local or Scottish feeling.
Monuments of this class may probably be the design, if not the work, of
foreign hands. In the second class are the monuments which seem to</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1611.</span>&mdash;Weem Church. Plan.</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">owe their design and execution to native skill, and amongst these may be
included this monument at Weem. The structure measures about 13 feet in
length at the base, and has a projection from the wall of about 2 feet.</p>

<p>The general scheme of the design is of an ordinary form, consisting of
an arched recess above a dado or pedestal, which is divided into three
panels separated from each other by delicate tapering shafts. At each
side rises a half round engaged shaft to carry the moulded arch above.
These shafts have capitals, rudely carved with oak leaves, supporting
square abaci. Above the arch there is a level cornice slightly broken at
intervals over figures beneath. At each side of the monument a large
figure stands on a finely designed pedestal, the one representing Faith
and the other Charity. The former holds a book with the inscription,
<i>Quidquid fit sine Fide est peccatum</i>, while the figure of Charity is
represented in the usual typical manner. The figures are surmounted with
very beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_621" id="page_621">{621}</a></span> canopies reaching nearly up to the cornice. Above the
cornice a rudimentary pediment contains the Menzies and Campbell arms
and monograms, over which, and leaning forward, is a panel having a
figure with</p>

<p class="nind">outstretched arms, supposed to symbolise the Creator. At each end of the
cornice is a kneeling figure placed before a small pedestal shaped like
a prie-dieu.</p>

<p>This monument having been erected not to the memory of one individual,
but of several, was probably not intended to contain any recumbent
figure, although the space for one is provided. Such a figure would have
in a great measure concealed the descriptive tablet and its accompanying
heraldry, which occupy the background of the recess. The monument bears
the date of the 24th January 1616, and was erected by the Sir Alexander
Menzies already referred to, to perpetuate the memory of his two wives
and of his maternal ancestors, beginning with his
great-great-grandmother. The names of all these ladies, with the arms of
their respective houses, adorn the monument, and need not be repeated
here, as full information regarding them will be found in Mr. Millar’s
work, already cited.</p>

<hr />

<h2>NOTE.</h2>

<p>The illustration or tailpiece on the following page shows a remarkable
specimen of early Scottish sculpture, preserved in the Museum of the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The stone, which is about 6 feet in length, was found in the River May,
Perthshire, and is supposed to have come from an ancient church which
formerly occupied a site within a rath or stronghold which stood on the
Holy Hill, on the bank of the river, near Forteviot, about two miles
from Forgandenny.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The last traces of the rath and church were swept
away by a flood which occurred in the beginning of this century.</p>

<p>This early church is probably that referred to in the legend of St.
Andrew given in the <i>Pictish Chronicle</i> as the church built at Forteviot
by Hungus, the Pictish king (731-761), in the last year of his reign,
after the arrival of the relics of St. Andrew in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Although
the character of the sculpture seems rather to suggest a date not quite
so early, it may, nevertheless, be surmised that the figures depicted on
the stone are those of King Hungus and his three sons, seated in the
usual royal attitude, with the sword across the knees.</p>

<p>From the arched form of the stone it seems most likely to have been a
chancel arch, a feature which would scarcely be expected in Scotland in
the eighth century. The primitive church may, however, have been
rebuilt, possibly in the tenth century, when a church with a chancel
would more probably be erected, having the stone in question for its
chancel arch. The small upright animal in the centre of the arch, having
a cross in front of it, seems to represent the Paschal lamb; while the
other nondescript animal at the feet of the king may be an early example
of the practice usual in mediæval monuments of resting the feet of the
effigy on an animal.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> On the Ruthwell Cross the figure of the

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p>The following is a statement by Mr. W. Galloway in defence of his views
regarding the date of the walls of St. Blane’s Church, Bute:<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Objections are taken in the notice of St. Blane’s Chapel, Bute
(Vol. <small>I.</small> p. 297), to the views advanced by me in the <i>Archæologia
Scotica</i> (Vol. <small>V.</small> p. 217) as to the priority in date and
construction of the rubble part of the chancel, over the Romanesque
structure conjoined with it. These are specially summarised under
three heads, in the first of which exception is taken to the fact
of there being a base, topped with a small splayed freestone
course, with rubble above and below, which is supposed to
contravene the ideas ordinarily entertained as to Celtic practice.
This practice, however, was strictly dependent upon and fixed by
the nature of the building materials that happened to be available
in any particular locality. In out of the way districts and far-off
islands, where freestone was unknown or not procurable, the builder
had to be content with the stone that came most readily to hand,
necessity, not choice, compelling his selection. This is proven by
the avidity with which the Celt took to freestone whenever it could
be got.</p>

<p>“No better illustration can be selected than Oransay Priory (Vol.
<small>III.</small> pp. 372-381). There the south cloister arcade, the door to the
church adjoining it, with the chapel projecting at the north-east
angle (and to these may be added the <i>Teampul na ghlinne</i>, on the
Colonsay side of the strand), are examples of rubble building, in
the local schist, where arches are turned and openings formed
without a trace of freestone or any material that could be hewn.
The portion of a mullion of transitional date found in the ruins
proves that freestone had been imported to the island by the close
of the twelfth century, and was in constant use thereafter.</p>

<p>“It would be a serious mistake, however, to place in the same
category the Island of Bute, where freestone (red) occurs locally,
and the best qualities of rock on the adjoining mainland. Freestone
was in common use with the Romans both for monumental work and
building, and it is precisely this simple splayed form of base
which is most frequently to be found. As to its use in Celtic work
there may be cited Cruggleton Chapel (Vol. <small>I.</small> pp. 212-215), about
three miles from Whitherne Priory, which by every criterion is
extremely primitive, much earlier than the priory, and also Celtic,
founded most probably by the Carrols or M‘Kerlies, who wrested the
castle from the Norse jarls. There the base, which has been laid on
the grass level, has a base course precisely similar to that of St.
Blane’s, with rubble above and below. In fact, the entire building
is rubble, except the dressed work and the chancel arch. It is not
freestone, but silurian grit, from the Stewartry shores. It is no
doubt later in date than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_626" id="page_626">{626}</a></span> St. Blane’s, but Bute is much more
favourably situated for freestone than Wigtonshire, where it is
locally non-existent, and the combination of rubble and hewn work
at Cruggleton is a striking testimony to the difficulty even of
obtaining grit.</p>

<p>“The second head refers to the mode in which the strings and base
courses would be stopped against the rubble. According to my
drawings there has been a string on the north side of the nave,
which dropped nearly two feet, has also run along the ashlar work
of the chancel, but only two feet or so of it remains. On the south
side this feature is entirely destroyed. The base, both on north
and south sides of the nave, returns round the chancel gable and
<i>there terminates</i>. Whether they were dropped also I cannot tell,
as these drawings were made previous to the later reduction of the
soil to the original level.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> An important point in this
junction of rubble and ashlar walls must be noted, viz., that while
the ashlar walls are 2 feet 7 inches thick, the rubble wall on the
south side is only 2 feet 5 inches, and that on the north 2 feet 3
inches. The walls meet flush on the outside, and on the inside the
ashlar corner is splayed off in accommodation to the thinner
rubble, and those who managed thus would find no difficulty in such
trivialities as a string or a base.</p>

<p>“Under the third head it is queried whether the ‘<i>Norman</i> builders’
were likely to show such tender mercy to a rubble fragment? I
presume ‘Norman’ here means <i>Anglo</i>-Norman, the conquering race,
who looked with contempt on all that pertained to those they held
in thrall. Civil changes notwithstanding, in Bute it was otherwise.
There the same traditions were handed down from Celt to Scot, and
the name of St. Blaan was reverenced, not merely on local grounds,
but as being still more intimately associated with a northern see.
The very curious <i>melange</i> at the east end of the chapel is
attributed to one of those ‘accidents’ which, from a variety of
sources, often befel buildings in ancient times. The late Mr John
Baird, at a meeting of the Architectural Institute of Scotland held
in Glasgow a good many years ago, suggested that the original
termination had been an apse, but the chancel being found too
small, this feature was demolished and the building extended to its
present limits. Notwithstanding all that has been said, I consider
both the apse and the accident theories to be at once untenable and
unnecessary, and will, as briefly as possible, give three
<i>criteria</i> on which I regard the proof of antecedency in date and
construction of the rubble work ultimately to depend, and to be
incontrovertible. First, in a rubble wall of any posterior date,
built to conjoin with a previous ashlar one, it is only reasonable
to suppose it would have been gauged to the same thickness, so that
the respective wall faces might be flush, both externally and
internally, so as to avoid the very awkward junction which there
really has been. Second, this rubble wall must necessarily have
been carried to the same height and level, in the wall-head, as the
ashlar built portion, instead of being dropped nearly three feet
below it, as the present rubble work really is. Third, the existing
Romanesque structure shows that freestone, both red and white, was
readily to be had by importation or otherwise in Bute, during the
twelfth century, and ever afterwards, and it is beyond all reason
and experience, that in the chancel especially rubble of some local
rock should have been adopted when the superior quality previously
in use could be so easily obtained.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_627" id="page_627">{627}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“These three <i>criteria</i> combined, the thinness (relatively) of the
rubble walling, the lower level of the wall-head, and the extreme
improbability of any subsequent builders being reduced to the
necessity of falling back on rubble, lead irresistibly to the
conviction that on this site there existed a much smaller and more
ancient chapel, of which the <i>sacrarium</i>, carefully respected by
all subsequent builders, now alone remains.”</p></div>

<p>At the special request of Mr. P. Macgregor Chalmers, author of the work
<i>A Scots Mediæval Architect</i>, we insert in this Volume extracts, revised
and approved by him, from his reply to our criticism contained in Vol.
<small>II.</small> pp. 378-382, in the hope that they may be found to throw additional
light on the late period of Scottish architecture. It must, however, be
understood that we are not to be held as concurring in all Mr. Chalmers’
views. Our notice of his work was written after our second volume was to
a large extent in type, and we should not have quoted Mr. Pinches’
reference to church building in Galloway in 1508 (p. 378), as Mr.
Chalmers had already shown in his work that this was a mistake; and on
the same page we should have acknowledged his labours on the Melrose
inscriptions. Mr. Chalmers says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“You tabulate four formal objections to my work (p. 380). The first
appears to be that I have adopted a certain opinion, which differs
from yours; and you think my work is therefore a ‘fiction,’ a
‘romance,’ a ‘dream.’ The second objection, based on your
<i>inference</i> that a man who had a Scots name was a Frenchman by
extraction, because he was born in Paris at a time when Scotsmen
were rife in France, need not be taken seriously. The answer to
your third and fourth objections is that I have <i>proved</i>, from
original documents quoted, that ‘Morow’ is ‘Murray,’ and that the
variation in spelling, indicated in the Melrose inscriptions, is
the variation for Murray. When you have grasped the importance and
significance of my deduction from the evident choice of Melrose for
the memorial inscriptions, I feel certain you will find more than
‘fiction’ in my work.</p>

<p>“I stated that the rood screen at Glasgow was erected by Archbishop
Blacader, and that it was probably begun about the year 1492. The
charter evidence is that the archbishop founded the two altars in
their present position in the base of the screen, and that he
founded the altar <i>for which the screen was erected</i>, the altar of
Holy Cross. As the screen encroaches considerably on the original
length of the choir, being of great depth from west to east, it is
natural to suppose that its erection would entail the remodelling
of the choir fittings. It was in the archbishop’s time, then, that
the new choir stalls were constructed. From the measurements given
in the contract for this work, between ‘the dene and cheptour of
Glasgw on the tapairt, and Mychell Waghorn, wrycht, on the toder
pairt,’ it is evident that the carved canopy work was carried as a
cornice across the east or choir side of the screen. Rejecting my
work, you state that the screen at Glasgow was probably built by
Bishop Cameron, who died in 1446. You have no charter evidence to
support you. You have only the mouldings and the sculpture of the
two periods to found your opinion upon. In the illustration I send
you (Fig. <a href="#fig_1">1</a>) I show the earlier mouldings at <span class="sans">A</span> and the later
mouldings of the screen at <span class="sans">B</span>. Students can now estimate the value
of your opinion. The only moulding in the aisle of Car Fergus, of
Blacader’s time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_628" id="page_628">{628}</a></span> is the vaulting rib which I show at <span class="sans">C</span>. This, you
say, is a ‘coarse’ moulding. But the coarseness is not apparent
when you compare it with the rib in the</p>

<p class="nind">sacristy (<span class="sans">D</span>), of date about 1446; the rib in the chapter house (<span class="sans">E</span>),
of date about 1425; or the same rib in the lower church, of date
about 1240. You frequently give expression to your opinion that the
work executed in Scotland about the year 1500 was ‘inferior.’
Sweeping generalisations of this kind are of no value in our work.
I send you a process block (Fig. <a href="#fig_2">2</a>). It illustrates the carved boss
in the vaulting of the aisle of Car Fergus, of Blacader’s time,
being the very first seen on entering, and so close to the eye that
it may almost be touched by the hand. No work of any
period&mdash;certainly not of Bishop Cameron’s time&mdash;can excel it in
beauty, and it is only one of many equally beautiful. You state
that the work in the screen ‘is considerably superior to that of
the adjoining altars, which are <i>certainly</i> by that bishop’
(<i>Archbishop</i> Blacader). It is a fact that you are here comparing
work, which is as sharp as when it left the carver’s hand, with
work at the floor level which is now so worn and defaced as almost
to be obliterated. The altars are of different design, and that now
on the north side is of <i>earlier date</i>, and was rebuilt and
repaired only by the archbishop. If this single altar stood
originally in the centre, as the one of the same name did at
Durham, and if, as is not impossible, it was originally built by
Bishop Cameron, then you condemn as ‘inferior’ what, if you had
only known, you ought to praise as ‘superior.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Honeyman, whose early opinion you quote, writing to me, for my
use here, says, in reference to the Glasgow rood screen&mdash;‘I must
say that circumstances which you have brought to my notice have
considerably changed my opinion regarding this. I quite recognise
the close affinity of the south transept door at Melrose and the
rood screen at Lincluden, and I am quite prepared to believe that
the man who designed these, also designed the rood screen here. If
it can be proved that the work at Melrose and Lincluden was not
executed till about 1480, or later, then I shall feel bound to
agree with you as to the age of our screen.’ The proof as to the
age of the Melrose door has been given in my book.</p>

<p>“Your reliance on your unwise generalisation regarding the
‘inferior’ quality of <i>all</i> work at the end of the fifteenth
century has blinded you to the facts at Melrose, as elsewhere. The
magnificent panel carved with the royal arms, of which I gave an
enlarged photograph (p. 55), is dated 1505. There is nothing finer
of its kind in the country, and the carved bosses in the presbytery
vault are remarkable for their rare beauty, and yet one of them
bears the arms of Margaret, wife of James <small>IV.</small> You state that ‘the
building or restoration of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_629" id="page_629">{629}</a></span> eastern part of the edifice seems,
from its style, to have been carried out towards the middle of the
fifteenth century’ (p. 372). The further statement is made that
‘the design of the choir appears to have been borrowed from that of
the transept’ (p. 370). These statements are contradictory. The
south transept was not erected until after the middle of the
fifteenth century, by Abbot Andrew Hunter. His arms are to be found
carved on it, and also in the nave chapel, where the work is
unmistakeably from the hand of the same designer. It is indubitable
that the ‘perpendicular’ work was inserted in the older transept.
It has never occurred to you to endeavour to explain the presence
in Scotland</p>

<p class="nind">of so marked a type of English art <i>in the middle of the fifteenth
century</i>, and you have thought it wise to ignore my interpretation
that this style was adopted as an expression of the international
good feeling arising from the marriage of James <small>IV.</small> with Margaret
of England. Perpendicular work is also present at Linlithgow and
Stirling, and there also it is associated with Queen Margaret.</p>

<p>“I described the statues at the apex of the east gable at Melrose
as those of James <small>IV.</small> and Margaret (p. 53). You say ‘this is an
entire assumption’ (p. 381), and then you immediately <i>assume</i> that
they illustrate the coronation of the Blessed Virgin. If your
interpretation is correct, the act of coronation must be indicated,
and the two figures must be correlated, Christ being turned towards
the Blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_630" id="page_630">{630}</a></span> Virgin, either to crown her by His own hand, or to
indicate His interest in the ceremony, whilst Mary is turned
towards Christ in an attitude of tenderness and adoration. These
are obvious requirements. The figures are so disposed in the
examples you cited and illustrated, and it is true of all the
examples I have studied on the Continent and in the cathedrals of
England. At Melrose the figures are not in any way related to each
other. They look straight forward, and, as I proved by the aid of a
telescope before writing my description, no act of crowning is
indicated. The male figure corresponds exactly with that on the
seal of James <small>IV.</small> to which I referred, and the group does not
differ from that shown in a MS. of the middle of the fifteenth
century, which represents a king and queen and their court. I
understand and appreciate the fact that you see no significance in
the angels in the niches below the central group of the king and
queen, and that it is of no importance to you that the figures
which were ranged on either side were not those of saints and
martyrs, but of Churchmen, evidently contemporaries of King James.
As the statue of an archbishop graces the apex of the east gable of
York Minster, there is nothing ridiculous, as you would wish to
make it appear, in a king and queen occupying a similar place at
Melrose. The circumstances and temper of the moment made it appear
appropriate. There is no sarcasm in the concluding paragraph of my
work, although you profess to be able to detect it. It was not
unpleasant to me to find that the point made by the author of <i>The
Stones of Venice</i>, from exactly similar exhibitions of vainglory,
could be made from the stones of Scotland.</p>

kindly supplied by Mr. W. Rae MacDonald:&mdash;On the recessed tomb of Bishop
Cardeny in the nave there are several coats of arms. These, so far as
they are legible, are&mdash;In centre of arch a small shield, quarterly 1st
and 4th, a fess chequé (of two rows of panes only) between three open
crowns, for Stewart and the Lordship of Garrioch; 2nd and 3rd, a bend
between six crosses potent fitchée, for Mar; the 3rd quarter is defaced,
but no doubt was the same as the 2nd. These arms appear on the seal of
Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar in right of his wife, Isabell Douglas
(see Laing’s <i>Seals</i>, Vol. <small>I.</small>, No. 796). There is a shield at each end
of the arch label; that on the east side is defaced; the west one bears
two chevronells engrailed, and has a mitre above it, for Bishop Cardeny.
On the pedestal there are four shields, supported by angels under arched
canopies, the shields being separated by five figures of ecclesiastics
with folded hands, and standing on pedestals. These four shields
bear&mdash;(1) Three pallets, for Atholl; (2) two chevronells, for Strathearn
(?); (3) defaced, but probably same as first; (4) faint traces of two
chevronells.</p></div>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
